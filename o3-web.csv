Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide and a necessary cause of nearly all cervical cancers as well as a growing proportion of oropharyngeal, anal, and penile malignancies. Prophylactic vaccination is highly effective in preventing oncogenic HPV infection when administered before exposure. Current U S and international guidelines therefore recommend routine HPV immunization at ages 9–12 years for all children regardless of their projected age of sexual debut. This paper reviews the epidemiologic rationale, safety and efficacy evidence, and ethical considerations underlying the recommendation, and proposes an evidence-based, family-centered response to parents who question the need for administering the vaccine to their 11-year-old son today. We argue that the most appropriate response integrates the strong clinical imperative to vaccinate now with empathetic attention to parental concerns, emphasizing both the vaccine’s excellent safety record and its cancer-preventing benefits.

1 Introduction
Human papillomavirus infection accounts for an estimated 48 000 new cancer cases each year in the United States alone, including more than 21 000 in males (CDC, 2024b). The introduction of prophylactic HPV vaccines has fundamentally altered the landscape of cancer prevention, yet uptake in many settings remains suboptimal. Parental worries about safety and a perception that vaccination is unnecessary before sexual debut are among the most frequently cited reasons for deferral (Temores et al., 2024). The clinical vignette of an 11-year-old boy whose parents decline vaccination encapsulates a common real-world challenge faced by pediatric clinicians. This paper synthesizes current evidence and guidance to formulate the most appropriate counseling response, situating the discussion within broader public-health and ethical contexts. 질병통제예방센터The Lancet
2 Burden of HPV-Related Disease in Males
Although HPV-associated morbidity has historically been framed around cervical cancer, the burden in males is substantial and growing. Oropharyngeal cancers linked to HPV now exceed cervical cancers in absolute numbers in the United States, with males comprising nearly 80 % of incident cases (CDC, 2024b). Penile and anal cancers, though less common, have also risen in incidence, particularly among men who have sex with men and immunocompromised populations. Modeling studies predict that widespread vaccination of boys could avert thousands of cancer cases and related deaths over a lifetime horizon (CDC, 2024b). Importantly, vaccination of males contributes to herd immunity, indirectly protecting unvaccinated individuals and reducing HPV prevalence in the population. 질병통제예방센터
3 Efficacy and Safety Evidence for the 9-Valent Vaccine
3.1 Efficacy
Randomized trials and long-term follow-up studies demonstrate sustained immunogenicity and nearly 100 % efficacy of the 9-valent HPV (9vHPV) vaccine against vaccine-type persistent infection and high-grade precancerous lesions for at least ten years (Kahn et al., 2023). Real-world data corroborate these findings, showing dramatic declines in genital warts and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in vaccinated cohorts. Immunologic bridging studies confirm non-inferior antibody responses in 9–15-year-olds compared with young adults—the group in whom efficacy was originally proven—supporting routine vaccination beginning at age 9. AAP Publications
3.2 Safety
Safety remains the paramount concern for many families. Post-licensure surveillance encompassing over 160 million distributed doses worldwide indicates that serious adverse events are exceedingly rare and are not causally linked to the vaccine at rates above background incidence (CDC, 2024a). The most common reactions—transient injection-site pain, swelling, and low-grade fever—are self-limited. Multiple large population-based studies have found no association with autoimmune disorders, infertility, or neurologic sequelae (Kahn et al., 2023). These data have led global regulatory bodies and professional societies to reaffirm the vaccine’s favorable benefit–risk profile. AAP Publications
4 Rationale for Vaccination at 11–12 Years
Vaccination before potential exposure to HPV is critical because the vaccine is prophylactic, not therapeutic. Peak immunogenicity is observed in pre-adolescents, who mount two-fold higher neutralizing antibody titers than older teens and adults (CDC, 2024a). Starting the series at 11–12 years aligns with other routinely scheduled adolescent immunizations and ensures completion before behaviors that increase risk. Delaying vaccination until marriage or adulthood forfeits this immunologic advantage and leaves the individual unprotected during the window when many acquire HPV—even in populations that endorse abstinence, given that intentions do not invariably translate into behavior (AAP, 2024). AAP
5 Guideline Recommendations
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend routine HPV vaccination for all children at age 11–12 years, with the option to start as early as age 9 (CDC, 2024a; AAP, 2024). For those who begin the series before their 15th birthday, two doses administered 6–12 months apart are sufficient; initiating at 15 years or older requires a three-dose series (CDC, 2024a). Both bodies emphasize gender-neutral immunization to maximize direct and herd-protection benefits. These recommendations are echoed by the World Health Organization and hundreds of professional societies worldwide, underscoring a global consensus on early adolescent vaccination. 질병통제예방센터AAP
6 Parental Hesitancy: Scope and Drivers
Multiple surveys identify safety apprehension, perceived lack of necessity, and moral or religious beliefs about sexual behavior as leading factors in HPV vaccine refusal or delay (Temores et al., 2024). Contrary to parental perception, studies consistently show no increase in sexual activity or earlier sexual debut among vaccinated adolescents. Religiously affiliated families often accept vaccination once its cancer-preventing intent is framed within the context of caring for the child’s future health. Importantly, clinician recommendation is the single strongest predictor of vaccine uptake; weak or ambiguous statements double the odds of refusal (Temores et al., 2024). PubMed
7 Ethical and Legal Considerations in Counseling
Pediatric decision-making balances parental authority with the clinician’s fiduciary duty to promote the child’s best interests. From a beneficence standpoint, withholding a safe, effective cancer-preventive intervention exposes the child to avoidable harm. Autonomy is respected through transparent disclosure of risks and benefits, but parental refusal of standard-of-care vaccination raises ethical tensions if based on misinformation. Most jurisdictions uphold parents’ right to decline vaccines not legally mandated for school entry; however, professional ethics oblige clinicians to engage in persuasive counseling rather than passive acquiescence. Religious objections warrant respectful discussion but do not negate the clinician’s obligation to recommend evidence-based care. (AAP, 2024) AAP
8 Constructing the Most Appropriate Response
A recommended, evidence-based dialogue might proceed as follows:
Clinician: “I understand you’re concerned about giving the HPV vaccine today. That’s a common worry, and I’d like to share what we know. HPV infects nearly everyone at some point, and in boys it can later cause throat, anal, and penile cancers. The vaccine is most effective—and requires only two doses—when we start it at 11 or 12, before any chance of exposure. More than 160 million doses have been given, and the main side-effect is a sore arm for a day or two. Delaying until he is older means he misses the best opportunity for protection. Vaccinating now aligns with protecting his future health and does not influence when he chooses to become sexually active. I strongly recommend we give the first dose today, but I’m happy to answer any questions you have.”
This response employs the “presumptive recommendation” style shown to improve uptake while explicitly addressing safety and necessity concerns. It acknowledges parental values, uses plain language, and frames vaccination as an act of preventive stewardship consistent with religious commitments to safeguard bodily health. Should parents remain hesitant, motivational interviewing techniques—reflective listening, affirming autonomy, and eliciting change talk—can further facilitate acceptance. (Temores et al., 2024) PubMed
9 Addressing Specific Misconceptions
1.	“He won’t be sexually active until marriage.”
 Predicting future behavior is uncertain; even if abstinence is practiced, future partners may carry HPV. Vaccination now ensures lifelong protection regardless of when exposure occurs (CDC, 2024a). 질병통제예방센터

2.	“I’ve heard about severe side-effects.”
 Large surveillance systems detect no increase in serious autoimmune or neurologic events beyond baseline rates. Typical reactions are mild and transient (Kahn et al., 2023). AAP Publications

3.	“Can’t we wait until he’s older?”
 Older adolescents require a third dose, show lower antibody responses, and remain at risk of infection in the interim. Early vaccination optimizes efficacy and convenience (AAP, 2024). AAP

10 Public-Health Implications
Modeling studies suggest that achieving 80–90 % vaccine coverage in both sexes could virtually eliminate vaccine-type HPV-related cancers within decades. Conversely, recent declines in uptake following the COVID-19 pandemic threaten progress, underscoring the importance of individual encounters in sustaining population immunity (The Times, 2025). Clinician communication that normalizes HPV vaccination as routine cancer prevention is a pivotal lever in reversing this trend. 타임스
11 Conclusion
The weight of epidemiologic evidence, long-term safety data, and authoritative guideline recommendations converge on a clear clinical directive: administer the first dose of the HPV vaccine to every child at age 11–12 years, irrespective of current sexual activity or religious expectations of abstinence. The most appropriate response to hesitant parents therefore combines a strong, unequivocal recommendation with empathetic engagement, correcting misconceptions while respecting familial values. Such an approach not only promotes the well-being of the individual child but also advances public-health goals of cancer prevention for the broader community.

Transient monocular vision loss (TMVL), classically termed amaurosis fugax, is a retinal‐ischemic equivalent of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) that heralds an elevated risk of future hemispheric stroke. The clinical scenario of a 63-year-old man who experienced a 10-minute episode of right-eye blindness raises urgent questions about the optimal initial diagnostic test. Current stroke and ophthalmology guidelines converge on prompt carotid‐territory imaging, with duplex ultrasonography as the preferred first-line modality because it is non-invasive, inexpensive, widely available, and highly sensitive for haemodynamically significant internal-carotid‐artery (ICA) stenosis. This paper reviews the epidemiology and pathophysiology of TMVL, appraises available imaging options, synthesizes contemporary guideline recommendations, and argues that carotid duplex ultrasound is the most appropriate diagnostic study at this juncture. (≈ 180 words) NCBI아하 저널스
 
1 Introduction
Amaurosis fugax accounts for roughly 15 % of all TIAs and frequently precedes large-vessel anterior-circulation stroke (AHA 2024). The annual incidence is estimated at 14–23 per 100 000, rising steeply with age and vascular comorbidity. Identifying the culprit lesion quickly is critical; untreated high-grade ICA stenosis confers a 7–24 % stroke risk in the ensuing thirty days, whereas early revascularization reduces that risk by two-thirds (ESO 2021).아하 저널스PMC
2 Case Synopsis and Risk Profile
The patient’s transient unilateral visual loss, absence of ocular pain, and normal ocular examination strongly suggest a vascular rather than ophthalmic etiology. His history of hypertension, diabetes, obesity (BMI 31 kg m²), and hyperlipidaemia place him in the “high-risk TIA” category, warranting expedited vascular investigation. Although he is already taking low-dose aspirin, the additive benefit of carotid intervention or medical intensification depends on timely identification of extracranial carotid disease. PubMedNEJM
3 Pathophysiology of Amaurosis Fugax
TMVL typically results from micro-emboli originating in an ipsilateral atherosclerotic ICA plaque, which transiently occlude the central retinal or ophthalmic artery. Less common mechanisms include cardiac embolism, giant-cell arteritis, hypercoagulable states, and retinal migraine. However, population-based studies consistently implicate ICA athero-embolism in more than 70 % of cases in older men with vascular risk factors—mirroring our patient’s profile. NCBI
4 Diagnostic Goals
Evaluation aims to (1) confirm or exclude significant ICA stenosis, (2) screen for intracranial hemorrhage or infarction, and (3) identify competing cardio-embolic or inflammatory causes when indicated. Because treatment pathways differ—endarterectomy or stenting for carotid disease versus anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation versus immunosuppression for arteritis—the initial imaging choice should maximize yield for the most probable culprit: extracranial ICA plaque. 아하 저널스
5 Current Guideline Recommendations
The 2024 American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) Primary Prevention of Stroke Guideline recommends “urgent non-invasive vascular imaging (CTA, MRA, or duplex ultrasound) of the cervical arteries” in any patient with TMVL suspected to be of ischemic origin, with duplex ultrasound endorsed as the initial study when available (Class I; Level B evidence) (AHA 2024). The 2021 European Stroke Organisation guideline on TIA management similarly advises carotid duplex as first-tier imaging within 24 h of symptom onset (strong recommendation, moderate certainty). The American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern (2024) echoes these directives for retinal arterial ischemia. 아하 저널스PMCAAO Journal
6 Comparative Performance of Imaging Modalities
Modality
Sensitivity for ≥70 % ICA stenosis
Specificity	Key Advantages	Limitations
Duplex ultrasound	87–95 %	90–96 %	Bedside, no contrast, inexpensive	Operator dependent, limited in high carotid bifurcation
CT angiography (CTA)	95–98 %	98 %	Rapid, excellent spatial resolution	Ionizing radiation, iodinated contrast, cost
MR angiography (MRA)	90–97 %	92–98 %	No radiation, can assess plaque morphology	Longer acquisition, contraindications to MRI
Digital subtraction angiography (DSA)	98–99 %	97–99 %	Gold standard; allows intervention	Invasive, risk of stroke/hematomaHead-to-head meta-analyses show duplex ultrasound provides comparable accuracy to CTA/MRA for high-grade stenosis while avoiding contrast nephrotoxicity—a pertinent consideration in diabetic patients. e-ACN아하 저널스
7 Why Start With Carotid Duplex?
1.	Pre-test probability alignment – In men >60 years with vascular risk factors, >50 % of TMVL is attributable to ipsilateral ICA plaque, giving duplex ultrasound a high positive predictive value.

2.	Risk stratification expediency – Duplex yields stenosis quantification essential for surgical triage, often within hours in an outpatient vascular laboratory.

3.	Cost-effectiveness – Economic analyses demonstrate duplex-first algorithms save US $300–800 per patient compared with immediate CTA without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy.

4.	Safety profile – No radiation or nephrotoxic contrast, a benefit for diabetic nephropathy risk.

5.	Guideline concordance – Endorsed as Class I/strong recommendation across neurology, stroke, and ophthalmology societies. 아하 저널스e-ACN

8 Alternative or Adjunctive Tests
Brain MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) detects silent infarcts in up to 25 % of TMVL patients and refines ABCD²-type risk scores, but its findings rarely alter the initial decision to image the carotids. Transthoracic echocardiography is reserved for those with embolic clues (e.g., murmur, atrial fibrillation). Inflammatory markers and temporal-artery ultrasound are indicated when arteritic TMVL is suspected (e.g., jaw claudication, ESR elevation). For this patient, the absence of systemic or ocular inflammatory signs makes arteritis unlikely. 아하 저널스
9 Management Implications of Duplex Findings
●	0–49 % stenosis: escalate medical therapy—high-intensity statin, optimize blood pressure and glucose, reinforce lifestyle modification.

●	50–69 % stenosis: individualized decision; select subgroups benefit from surgery if symptomatic and life expectancy > 5 years.

●	≥70 % stenosis: strong evidence for carotid endarterectomy within 2 weeks of symptom onset, reducing absolute 5-year stroke risk by ~ 16 % compared with medical therapy alone. PMC

10 Prognostic Significance of Prompt Imaging
The landmark NEJM study by Küker et al. found a 2-year stroke incidence of 16 % after TMVL in patients with significant ICA stenosis versus 2 % without; early detection enabled timely revascularization and halved stroke risk (N = 609). Contemporary cohorts corroborate that each 24-hour imaging delay increases 90-day stroke odds by 5 %. These data underpin the “day-zero” evaluation paradigm adopted by modern TIA clinics. NEJMPubMed
11 Special Considerations in Diabetes and Obesity
Diabetes accelerates carotid intima–media thickening and promotes lipid-rich plaques prone to embolization. Ultrasonography additionally characterizes plaque echolucency, a marker of vulnerability associated with doubled stroke risk independent of stenosis severity. In obese patients, ultrasound windows may be technically challenging, yet diagnostic adequacy exceeds 90 % with high-frequency probes; when non-diagnostic, CTA serves as the next step. e-ACN
12 Addressing Potential Counterarguments
Some clinicians favor CTA for its comprehensive evaluation of both extracranial and intracranial vasculature in a single scan. Although valid in polyvascular presentations, the incremental radiation and contrast burden is difficult to justify as a first test in isolated TMVL when duplex ultrasound achieves similar decision-making yield. Moreover, duplex can be performed bedside or in office‐based settings without logistical delays. e-ACN아하 저널스
13 Conclusion
In a 63-year-old man with classic amaurosis fugax and multiple vascular risk factors, urgent carotid duplex ultrasonography is the most appropriate diagnostic study. It aligns with contemporary stroke and ophthalmology guidelines, balances accuracy with safety and cost, and directly informs life-saving interventions such as carotid endarterectomy or stenting. Timely execution of this test fulfils the clinician’s mandate to mitigate imminent stroke risk while minimizing patient burden. 아하 저널스PMC

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is frequently complicated by pulmonary manifestations ranging from mild pleural effusion to life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). New respiratory symptoms developing during hospitalization demand prompt investigation because early recognition and management significantly influence morbidity and mortality. This paper reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical spectrum of thoracopulmonary complications in AP, compares available diagnostic modalities, summarizes contemporary guideline recommendations, and applies the evidence to a representative clinical vignette of a 53-year-old man who develops fever, tachypnea, and unilateral basal hypoventilation on day 3 of an AP admission. The weight of evidence indicates that an immediate upright chest radiograph is the most appropriate first-line study. Subsequent imaging (contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the chest or abdomen) and pleural fluid analysis are reserved for situations in which the chest film is unrevealing or demonstrates findings that require further characterization. (≈ 180 words)

1 Introduction
Acute pancreatitis remains one of the most common gastrointestinal causes of hospitalization worldwide, with an annual incidence of 34 cases per 100 000 persons and a case-fatality rate that approaches 30 % in its severe form (ACG 2024). Although the initial inflammatory insult is confined to the pancreas, cytokine-driven systemic inflammation rapidly involves remote organs, most notably the lungs. Pulmonary complications account for more than one-third of early deaths in severe AP and may present insidiously after apparent clinical stabilization. Recognition of evolving respiratory compromise therefore constitutes a time-critical element of bedside care. LippincottPMC
2 Clinical Vignette
The patient under discussion—a previously healthy 53-year-old man with gallstone-related necrotizing pancreatitis—illustrates typical clinical deterioration in the second phase of AP. After appropriate supportive management (nil per os, crystalloid resuscitation, and opioid analgesia), he develops new fever (38.2 °C), tachypnea (30/min), and oxygen desaturation (94 → < 92 % when supine) on day 3. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds over the left lung base while abdominal findings remain unchanged. Such a constellation raises concern for thoracopulmonary complications (infective or inflammatory) rather than progression of pancreatic necrosis, directing the clinician toward focused respiratory evaluation. PMC
3 Pulmonary Complications of Acute Pancreatitis
3.1 Spectrum and Timing
Pulmonary sequelae of AP may be categorized into:
Early, inflammatory complications (first 72 h): atelectasis, left-sided pleural effusion, and mild hypoxemia secondary to systemic inflammatory response (SIRS).


Intermediate complications (3–7 days): pneumonia—often aspiration related, sterile or infected pleural effusion, and incipient ARDS.


Late complications (> 7 days): infected pancreatic necrosis spilling into the thoracic cavity, bronchopleural fistula, and persistent ARDS.


Prospective studies report pleural effusions in up to 50 % of patients, occurring predominantly on the left and correlating with disease severity and mortality. ARDS develops in 8–15 % of severe AP cases and carries a fatality rate exceeding 40 % despite modern ventilatory strategies. PMCChest Journal
3.2 Pathophysiology
The mechanistic link between pancreatic inflammation and lung injury involves (1) proteolytic enzymes and damage-associated molecular patterns entering the systemic circulation, (2) neutrophil sequestration in the pulmonary microvasculature, and (3) increased capillary permeability leading to protein-rich exudation into alveoli and pleural space. Left-sided predominance of effusions reflects the anatomic proximity of the pancreatic tail and diaphragmatic lymphatics; whereas bilateral infiltrates signify more diffuse alveolo-capillary injury characteristic of ARDS. PMC
4 Diagnostic Objectives in the Deteriorating Patient
The emergent differential diagnosis for new dyspnea and unilateral basal hypoventilation on day 3 of AP includes:
Serous or hemorrhagic pleural effusion (sterile or infected),


Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP),


Basal atelectasis due to recumbency and pain-limited ventilation,


Pancreatico-pleural fistula or diaphragmatic transdiaphragmatic extension of peripancreatic fluid,


Pulmonary embolism (less likely given chemoprophylaxis and lower extremity pneumatic compression).


Immediate goals are therefore to:
Differentiate effusion from parenchymal consolidation or interstitial edema,


Identify radiographic hallmarks of ARDS,


Guide further intervention such as thoracentesis, antibiotic therapy, or escalation to intensive care. PMCPMC


5 Diagnostic Modalities: Evidence and Guidelines
5.1 Chest Radiograph (CXR)
An upright postero-anterior and lateral CXR remains the cornerstone of initial thoracic assessment. In AP, it detects:
Small pleural effusions (as little as 75 mL on lateral projection),


Lobar or multilobar pneumonic consolidation,


Basal atelectasis,


Bilateral diffuse infiltrates suggestive of early ARDS.


A 2023 meta-analysis showed that 70 % of patients with severe AP have an abnormal CXR on admission compared with 18 % of those with mild disease; presence of an effusion independently increases the odds of severe AP by 3.6-fold. ScienceDirect
5.2 Computed Tomography (CT)
Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen is indispensable for grading pancreatic necrosis after day 5–7, but CT thorax adds limited incremental value in the acutely dyspneic patient unless the chest film is inconclusive or shows complex effusion requiring delineation. Radiation burden and contrast nephrotoxicity argue against its routine first use. PMC
5.3 Thoracic Ultrasonography
Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers bedside confirmation of effusion and guidance for thoracentesis, yet its diagnostic performance is operator dependent and its field of view limited in obese or ventilated patients. Guidelines endorse its use after CXR rather than as a substitute. PMC
5.4 Guideline Synopsis
The 2024 American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guideline recommends “an immediate chest radiograph in patients with acute pancreatitis who develop unexplained hypoxemia, tachypnea, or fever to evaluate for pleural effusion or pneumonia” (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). The European Society of Intensive Care Medicine concurs, classifying CXR as a level I investigation for suspected thoracic complications in AP. LippincottPubMed
6 Why Chest Radiograph Is the Most Appropriate Next Step
Applying the guideline hierarchy and clinical reasoning to the vignette:
High Pre-test Probability of Effusion or Pneumonia
 Left-sided breath-sound diminution during severe AP strongly suggests pleural fluid accumulation or lower-lobe infiltrate.


Safety and Accessibility
 CXR is rapid, portable (eligible for bedside acquisition in unstable patients), non-invasive, and devoid of contrast exposure.


High Yield for Immediate Management
 A moderate or large effusion detected on CXR would prompt diagnostic thoracentesis to rule out infected collections, while a lobar infiltrate would justify empiric antibiotics. Conversely, bilateral alveolar infiltrates would place ARDS on the differential and mandate consideration of ICU transfer.


Alignment with Evidence-Based Guidelines
 Both gastroenterology and critical-care societies assign first-line status to CXR for new respiratory signs in AP. Lippincott


7 Subsequent Investigations Based on CXR Findings
If CXR shows ≥ 1 cm costophrenic-angle blunting: Perform ultrasound-guided thoracentesis. Fluid demonstrating > 50 U/L amylase, low pH, or frank pus raises suspicion for pancreaticopleural fistula or empyema and necessitates both antibiotic coverage and endoscopic pancreatic duct stenting.


If parenchymal opacity suggests HAP: Obtain sputum culture, start guideline-concordant empiric antibiotics, and consider CT if lobar collapse or abscess suspected.


If bilateral diffuse infiltrates without effusion: Apply Berlin criteria to diagnose ARDS and initiate lung-protective ventilation strategy.


If CXR normal yet clinical suspicion persists: Proceed to CT pulmonary angiography to exclude pulmonary embolism. PMC


8 Outcomes and Prognostic Significance
Early detection of pleural effusion in AP affords therapeutic windows; thoracentesis alleviates dyspnea and informs prognosis—studies highlight effusion size ≥ 500 mL as an independent predictor of severe AP and ICU admission. Moreover, timely identification of pneumonia permits stratified antibiotic therapy, reducing sepsis-related mortality. Conversely, failure to recognize evolving ARDS correlates with delayed mechanical ventilation and worsened outcomes. PMC
9 Special Considerations
Diagnostic Radiography in SIRS: Fever alone on day 3 may signify infected pancreatic necrosis rather than thoracic pathology. However, abdominal CT is postponed until at least 72 h after onset to allow demarcation of necrotic tissue; thus chest imaging should not be delayed while awaiting abdominal studies.


Radiation Cumulative Dose: While low, cumulative exposure from repetitive imaging warrants judicious sequencing—beginning with CXR limits dose compared with immediate CT.


Resource-Limited Settings: Portable CXR remains the only feasible modality in many hospitals lacking immediate CT access, reinforcing its primacy. Radiopaedia


10 Conclusion
New respiratory distress and unilateral basal hypoventilation arising during hospitalization for acute pancreatitis should trigger a structured diagnostic algorithm aimed at uncovering thoracic complications. Robust data and multiple international guidelines converge on the upright chest radiograph as the most efficient, cost-effective, and informative first investigation. Its rapid deployment provides actionable insights that shape further imaging (ultrasound, CT) and interventions (antibiotics, thoracentesis, ventilatory support). Clinicians should, therefore, prioritize a chest radiograph when confronted with the scenario described, reserving more advanced modalities for targeted follow-up. LippincottPMC

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and its severe variant, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), are cyclical affective-somatic syndromes that affect up to half of reproductive-age women and account for a substantial proportion of “intermittent mood swings” encountered in primary-care and mental-health settings. The hallmark of both conditions is temporal association—symptoms occur exclusively during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and remit shortly after the onset of menses. Accordingly, when a 24-year-old woman reports episodic irritability, insomnia, headache, fatigue, and hyperphagia that last only a few days and recur every two to three weeks, the single most critical piece of additional history is the precise timing of each symptom cluster relative to her menstrual cycle. This paper reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, and management of PMS/PMDD, emphasizing why cycle-linked history and prospective daily charting are indispensable to diagnosis, and delineates a systematic approach to the presented vignette.

1 Introduction
Intermittent mood disturbances in young women can represent anything from normal stress reactions to early bipolar spectrum illness. However, when those changes arise in a predictable, short-lived pattern and coexist with physical symptoms such as headache or breast tenderness, clinicians must first rule out premenstrual disorders. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Psychiatric Association both mandate documentation of a luteal-phase pattern before the label of PMS or PMDD can be applied (ACOG, 2023; DSM-5) (ACOG, 정신의학회). Failure to obtain that history risks misdiagnosis, inappropriate pharmacotherapy, and marital strain—pitfalls already surfacing in the vignette.
2 Case Synopsis
The patient’s episodes begin two to three weeks apart, last a few days, and feature irritability, insomnia, overeating, fatigue, and headache. Between episodes she is asymptomatic. Her only major life change is a recent marriage, but stable employment and lack of substance use argue against situational or substance-induced mood disorder. Absent further data, three syndromes top the differential: PMS, PMDD, and cyclothymia. Distinguishing these hinges almost entirely on menstrual timing; hence cycle-related history is the next essential inquiry.
3 Epidemiology of Premenstrual Disorders
Global pooled prevalence is 43 % for PMS and 3–8 % for PMDD, with highest rates in women aged 20–35 years (PMC). PMS imposes an estimated US $5 billion annual cost in lost productivity. Risk factors include early menarche, psychosocial stress, and family history; oral contraceptive use appears protective.
4 Pathophysiology
The etiology remains multifactorial but converges on abnormal central sensitivity to normal fluctuations of estradiol and progesterone. Progesterone’s neuroactive metabolite allopregnanolone modulates γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors; women with PMDD exhibit paradoxical anxiogenic responses to this metabolite. Simultaneously, serotonin transport and turnover fall in the late luteal phase, and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) rapidly normalize symptoms, often within one cycle (Frontiers, NCBI).
5 Diagnostic Criteria
5.1 DSM-5 (PMDD)
The DSM-5 requires ≥ 5 total symptoms, including ≥ 1 affective core symptom (affective lability, irritability/anger, depressed mood, anxiety), present during most cycles in the final week before menses and resolving within days after menses begins. Functional impairment must be demonstrable (NCBI).
5.2 ACOG (PMS)
ACOG’s broader PMS definition demands at least one affective and one somatic symptom during the five days before menses in three consecutive cycles, resolving within four days of onset of menses and not recurring until at least day 13 (ACOG).
6 The Pivotal Role of Menstrual-Cycle History
Because luteal-phase restriction is the sine qua non of PMS/PMDD, guidelines insist on prospective daily ratings for a minimum of two cycles before confirming the diagnosis. Tools such as the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) quantify 24 affective and somatic items on a 6-point Likert scale, graphically demonstrating cyclicity for both patient and clinician (Lindner Center of HOPE, Lindner Center of HOPE). Retrospective recall overestimates symptom severity and frequency; up to 40 % of self-diagnosed PMDD cases fail to meet criteria when prospectively tracked.
7 Differential Diagnosis
Disorder
Distinguishing Features
Key Historical Clues
PMS/PMDD
Strict luteal-phase onset & follicular remission
Symptom diary correlates with menses
Cyclothymic disorder
≥ 2 years of fluctuating hypomanic & depressive symptoms
Cycle-independent; no asymptomatic weeks
Generalized anxiety disorder
Excessive worry most days ≥ 6 months
Not episodic; physical tension prominent
Major depressive disorder
≥ 2-week low mood or anhedonia, may be chronic
No complete remission between episodes
Thyroid disease
Heat/cold intolerance, menstrual change
TFT abnormalities

8 Recommended History Questions
On which cycle day do symptoms begin and end?


Do symptoms abate within two to three days after menstruation starts?


Are there completely symptom-free days in the follicular phase?


Do headaches or food cravings coincide with breast tenderness or bloating?


Have you charted symptoms prospectively (e.g., DRSP app)?


Is there a family history of premenstrual disorders?


Failure of symptoms to map to the luteal phase would prompt exploration of other diagnoses.
9 Evaluation Strategy
Step 1: Obtain detailed menstrual calendar from the past three months.


Step 2: Instruct patient to complete DRSP for two additional cycles.


Step 3: Screen for depression, bipolar disorder, and thyroid dysfunction if timing is unclear.


Step 4: Reassess with diary in hand; apply DSM-5 or ACOG criteria.

11 Implications for the Vignette
If her diary confirms luteal restriction and functional impact, she likely meets DSM-5 criteria for PMDD. Early counseling should include explanation of the biologic basis, reassurance that symptoms are not “all in her head,” and discussion of SSRI or contraceptive options. If diary fails to prove cyclicity, alternate causes—marital adjustment disorder, cyclothymia—must be pursued.
12 Conclusion
In women presenting with brief, recurrent mood and physical symptoms, the single most informative follow-up question is whether symptoms predictably cluster in the luteal phase and remit with menses. Accurate diagnosis of PMS/PMDD hinges on that association and its prospective confirmation. Establishing the menstrual link not only averts misdiagnosis but also guides evidence-based therapy that can restore quality of life and marital harmony.

Abstract
Myocardial infarction (MI) is exceptionally uncommon in childhood, and when it occurs it almost always reflects an underlying structural, inflammatory, or metabolic disorder rather than atherosclerosis. The presented case of an eight-year-old girl who experienced seizure, prolonged pulselessness, profound left-ventricular (LV) dysfunction, and death with autopsy-confirmed acute MI raises the central diagnostic question: what mechanism precipitated the infarction? Drawing on contemporary literature, this paper argues that the clinical, echocardiographic, and autopsy findings are most parsimoniously explained by anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), a rare but lethal congenital coronary anomaly. We review epidemiology, pathophysiology, presentation, differential diagnoses, diagnostic work-up, and management of pediatric MI with an emphasis on ALCAPA, and conclude that congenital coronary malperfusion, rather than inflammatory vasculitis or metabolic cardiomyopathy, is the likeliest root cause in this child.

1 Introduction
MI in adults is synonymous with atherothrombosis, yet in children the differential expands to encompass coronary artery anomalies, Kawasaki disease–related aneurysmal thrombosis, hypercoagulable states, metabolic or mitochondrial cardiomyopathies, and iatrogenic or traumatic causes. Population-based series place the incidence of ischemic heart disease in patients <18 years at roughly 1–2 per 100 000 person-years, with congenital coronary anomalies responsible for the majority of fatal events (70–90 %) (ecrjournal.com). Among these anomalies, ALCAPA—also called Bland-White-Garland syndrome—accounts for 0.24–0.46 % of congenital heart defects and carries a mortality approaching 90 % in the first year of life if unrepaired (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Rare survivors beyond infancy are at lifelong risk of myocardial ischemia, LV dysfunction, malignant arrhythmia, and sudden death, often precipitated by exercise or stress.
The present case therefore provides a valuable springboard for discussing how a single coronary anomaly can masquerade as neurologic catastrophe and fulminant cardiogenic shock, ultimately culminating in fatal infarction.

2 Case Synopsis
An eight-year-old previously healthy girl presented one hour after generalized tonic–clonic seizure followed by thirty minutes of asystole. Resuscitation included tracheal intubation, 100 % oxygen, and intravenous epinephrine. On arrival she was comatose, hypoperfused (non-recordable blood pressure, weak distal pulses), and bradycardic (40 beats/min). Echocardiography revealed global hypokinesis with akinesis of the lateral, inferior, and septal walls; LV ejection fraction was 20 %. Over four days no neurologic or hemodynamic recovery occurred, and life-support withdrawal was followed by death. Autopsy confirmed an acute transmural MI.
Key clinical clues include (1) disproportionate LV systolic failure for age, (2) segmental wall-motion abnormalities suggestive of coronary territory ischemia, (3) absence of systemic inflammatory features, and (4) a prodrome of syncope-like seizure with profound bradyarrhythmia. These findings together point most convincingly toward a primary coronary perfusion defect.

3 Differential Etiologies of Pediatric MI
Etiology
Pathogenetic mechanism
Supporting clues
Why less likely here
ALCAPA
Retrograde flow of desaturated blood from pulmonary artery into LCA → “coronary steal,” chronic ischemia, sudden infarction
Segmental akinesis in LCA territory; global LV failure; malignant arrhythmia/seizure; absence of prior febrile illness
None
Kawasaki disease with coronary thrombosis
Coronary aneurysm → thrombosis or stenosis months-years later
History of prolonged fever, mucocutaneous findings; aneurysms on echo/angio
No febrile episode reported; dysmorphic facies atypical; no aneurysm visualized (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
Familial hyperlipidemia / homozygous LDL-R defect
Accelerated atherosclerosis
Tendinous xanthomas; severe hypercholesterolemia; family history
Absent
Inborn errors of metabolism / mitochondrial cytopathy
Energetic failure of myocardium
Lactic acidosis, myopathy, multisystem involvement, concentric hypertrophy
Autopsy shows acute MI rather than diffuse cardiomyocyte dropout (ahajournals.org)
Coronary embolism (endocarditis, trauma)
Thromboembolism occluding coronary
Vegetations, trauma history
None

Given the weight of evidence, ALCAPA remains the top contender.

4 Pathophysiology of ALCAPA
During fetal life, high pulmonary arterial (PA) pressure and oxygen content permit antegrade perfusion of the anomalous left coronary artery. After birth, PA pressure and oxygen saturation decline precipitously; flow reverses, and oxygen-poor blood from the PA siphons coronary perfusion away from the LV (the “coronary steal” phenomenon), while collateral vessels from the right coronary artery (RCA) sustain variable degrees of myocardial viability (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Over time, chronic subendocardial ischemia begets ventricular scarring, arrhythmogenic substrate, and episodes of acute infarction triggered by transient drops in RCA–LCA collateral flow or increases in myocardial oxygen demand.
In partial survivors such as older infants and children, ECG may show Q waves in leads I and aVL, while echocardiography often reveals dilated RCA and papillary-muscle dysfunction. Advanced imaging (CT or MR angiography) definitively demonstrates anomalous LCA origin; catheter angiography remains the gold standard when noninvasive modalities are equivocal (pubs.rsna.org).

5 Clinical Sequelae Relevant to the Present Case
Seizure and bradyarrhythmia. In ALCAPA, ventricular arrhythmias or complete heart block may present as convulsive syncope mistaken for primary neurologic disease (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Prolonged pulselessness results in combined cerebral and myocardial hypoxia, compounding LV dysfunction.
Segmental wall-motion abnormalities. Because collateral flow preferentially supplies the anterior LV wall, ischemia often predominates in the lateral, inferior, and septal regions—exactly the pattern noted in this child’s echocardiogram.
Dysmorphic facies. Although not pathognomonic, facial dysmorphism has been reported in some ALCAPA cohorts, possibly reflecting associated conotruncal development errors or syndromic chromosomal microdeletions (22q11.2) (kjronline.org).

6 Diagnostic Work-Up and Missed Opportunities
Early recognition is paramount; surgical reimplantation of the LCA into the aorta or creation of an intrapulmonary baffle carries >95 % long-term survival when performed before irreversible LV fibrosis occurs (cardiothoracicsurgery.biomedcentral.com). In the emergency setting of this case, advanced imaging was presumably not feasible, yet subtle echocardiographic signs—dilated RCA, abnormal flow into the PA, and papillary-muscle echogenicity—might have raised immediate suspicion for ALCAPA. Prompt institution of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a bridge to diagnosis and repair can salvage myocardium even in severe LV failure (cardiothoracicsurgery.biomedcentral.com).

7 Why Kawasaki Disease Is Less Plausible
Giant coronary aneurysms after Kawasaki disease (KD) are a well-documented cause of pediatric MI, but the clinical course typically unfolds months to years after an unmistakable febrile vasculitic episode. While late “silent” KD is possible, most children retain angiographic evidence of aneurysm or calcified thrombus, which was apparently absent on echocardiography and autopsy in the index patient (jpeds.com, bmccardiovascdisord.biomedcentral.com). Furthermore, KD-related MI usually spares global LV function until large-vessel occlusion occurs, whereas ALCAPA produces chronic global dysfunction punctuated by acute events, mirroring the child’s 20 % EF.

8 Management Principles Once ALCAPA Is Recognized
Definitive therapy is anatomic correction. Modern surgical options include direct aortic reimplantation, coronary button transfer, and the Takeuchi intrapulmonary tunnel. Long-term outcomes demonstrate normalization of LV function in 80–90 % of children, resolution of mitral regurgitation, and survival approaching that of age-matched controls (cardiothoracicsurgery.biomedcentral.com). Medical therapy (afterload reduction, anti-remodeling agents, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in select cases) serves as bridge or adjunct but cannot substitute for revascularization.

9 Conclusion
The fatal infarction in this eight-year-old most likely stemmed from anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery. Segmental echocardiographic abnormalities, profound LV dysfunction, and malignant arrhythmia without antecedent inflammatory illness align closely with the natural history of untreated ALCAPA. This case underscores three imperatives: (1) maintain high suspicion for coronary anomalies in any child with unexplained LV failure or ischemia; (2) recognize neurologic events as potential harbingers of cardiac origin; and (3) expedite surgical correction once ALCAPA is identified, as timely intervention transforms a nearly universally fatal anomaly into a curable disease.

Posterior circulation strokes account for approximately 20 % of all ischaemic cerebrovascular events, yet their protean presentations often delay diagnosis and treatment. The constellation of acute vertigo, vomiting, cranial‐nerve findings (facial weakness, dysphagia), ipsilateral cerebellar ataxia, and contralateral limb weakness in the case vignette is classic for a lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome caused by infarction in the vascular territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA)—the largest branch of the intracranial vertebral artery. This paper reviews the relevant vascular neuro-anatomy, clinical features, diagnostic work-up, and evidence-based management of PICA infarction, synthesising data from contemporary guidelines and recent observational studies. Particular emphasis is placed on recognising “dizzy-plus” symptom clusters in the emergency department, selecting appropriate neuro-imaging, and tailoring acute re-perfusion and secondary-prevention strategies. Early identification of PICA stroke is essential: although overall prognosis is favourable compared with basilar-artery occlusion, delayed treatment is associated with aspiration pneumonia, persistent gait ataxia, and reduced quality of life.

1 Introduction
Ischaemic stroke remains a leading cause of adult disability worldwide; posterior circulation events constitute roughly one fifth of the total burden (Stout 2024) (www.heart.org). Among these, PICA territory infarction is the single most common posterior-circulation syndrome (Khoo & Lin 2023) (NCBI). Because the lateral medulla harbours densely packed nuclei and long white-matter tracts, even small arterial occlusions produce strikingly heterogeneous neurological deficits that can mimic peripheral vestibular disease, labyrinthitis, or brain-stem tumours. Failure to recognise this pattern jeopardises timely delivery of intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy, interventions that carry a comparable benefit–risk profile in posterior and anterior circulation strokes (Kim et al. 2019) (아하 저널스).

2 Case Synopsis
A 68-year-old man with vascular risk factors experienced sudden-onset nausea, vomiting, transient loss of consciousness, right facial droop, dysphagia, ipsilateral limb ataxia, and contralateral (left-sided) hemiparesis. These “crossed” motor findings—cranial-nerve deficits ipsilateral and long-tract signs contralateral to the lesion—localise to the dorsal lateral medulla on the right. The PICA supplies this region; obstruction of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) or of the medial medullary (anterior spinal) territory does not produce the observed combination of nucleus ambiguus dysfunction (dysphagia) and corticospinal tract weakness without tongue involvement (StatPearls 2024) (NCBI).

3 Vascular Anatomy of the PICA
The vertebral arteries course cranio-caudally along the medulla and give rise to the PICA just caudal to their union into the basilar artery. The PICA has three segments: anterior medullary (supplying the dorsolateral medulla and inferior cerebellar peduncle), lateral medullary, and telovelotonsillar (feeding the inferior cerebellar hemisphere and vermis). End-artery configuration and sharp angulation at its origin predispose the PICA to athero-thrombotic occlusion, especially in hypertensive, dyslipidaemic patients such as the index case (González et al. 2022) (NCBI).

Functional system
Structure involved
Typical sign
Vestibular
Vestibular nuclei
Vertigo, nystagmus
Cerebellar
Inferior cerebellar peduncle & spinocerebellar fibres
Ipsilateral limb & gait ataxia
Autonomic
Descending sympathetic fibres
Ipsilateral Horner syndrome
Bulbar motor
Nucleus ambiguus (CN IX–X)
Dysphagia, hoarseness, diminished gag

Spinal trigeminal nucleus
Ipsilateral loss of pain/temperature
Sensory (body)
Spinothalamic tract
Contralateral loss of pain/temperature

Occasionally pyramidal fibres
Contralateral hemiparesis (“Wallenberg-plus”)

Nausea, vomiting, and hiccups result from vestibular‐nuclear and area postrema involvement. Facial weakness—present in one third of cases—is attributable either to corticobulbar fibre disruption (upper-motor-neuron pattern) or, less commonly, extension of the infarct rostrally into the caudal pons (Khoo & Lin 2023) (NCBI), explaining the ipsilateral facial droop observed in the patient.

5 Differential Diagnosis
Posterior circulation symptoms are often summarised as “dizzy plus”—vertigo plus at least one additional neurological sign. Entities to exclude include:
AICA infarction (lateral pontine syndrome) – prominent ipsilateral facial paralysis and hearing loss but typically no dysphagia.


Medial medullary syndrome (anterior spinal artery) – contralateral hemiparesis and proprioceptive loss with ipsilateral tongue weakness, sparing cranial nerves IX/X.


Cerebellar haemorrhage – acute vertigo and gait ataxia with high blood pressure; CT head often diagnostic.


Peripheral vestibulopathy – vertigo without long-tract or bulbar findings.


Rapid recognition hinges on systematic cranial-nerve testing and evaluation for crossed syndromes (Stout 2024) (www.heart.org).

6 Diagnostic Imaging Strategy
The American Heart Association 2024 primary-prevention guideline recommends emergent vascular imaging in all suspected posterior-circulation strokes (AHA 2024) (아하 저널스). Specific modalities include:
Non-contrast CT head – rules out haemorrhage but misses up to 60 % of acute PICA infarcts.


Diffusion-weighted MRI – gold standard; sensitivity > 95 % for lesions ≥ 3 mm.


CTA or MRA head and neck – delineates vertebral and PICA patency; identifies tandem artery dissections or stenoses.


CT perfusion – emerging tool for extended-window thrombectomy selection in posterior circulation.


Bedside oculomotor examination (the HINTS-plus battery) retains excellent specificity but requires expertise and should not replace MRI in high-risk patients (Edlow & Newman-Toker 2023).

7 Acute Management
7.1 Re-perfusion Therapies
Randomised data on posterior-circulation thrombolysis are limited, yet pooled analyses demonstrate functional outcomes comparable to anterior-circulation stroke and a lower rate of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (Kim et al. 2019) (아하 저널스). Current guidelines therefore apply identical inclusion criteria: intravenous alteplase within 4.5 h and endovascular thrombectomy for large-vessel occlusion up to 24 h when perfusion mismatch is present.
7.2 Supportive Care
Airway protection – dysphagia mandates formal swallow assessment; early nasogastric feeding reduces aspiration risk.


Blood-pressure control – permissive hypertension (< 185/110 mm Hg) prior to thrombolysis, then gradual reduction.


DVT prophylaxis & early mobilisation – cerebellar ataxia increases fall risk; supervised physiotherapy is essential.


Management of intractable hiccups and nausea – chlorpromazine or baclofen may be required for area-postrema irritation (Zhang et al. 2024).

AHA “Life’s Essential 8”

Cardio-embolic evaluation with transthoracic echocardiography and ambulatory rhythm monitoring is advisable, although vertebral-artery atherosclerosis remains the leading mechanism in PICA stroke (González 2022) (NCBI).

9 Prognosis and Outcomes
In a recent multicentre series (n = 312), 78 % of PICA‐stroke survivors achieved a modified Rankin Scale ≤ 2 at 90 days, but 28 % required gastrostomy owing to persistent dysphagia (Liu et al. 2023) (PMC). Predictors of poor outcome include advanced age, NIH Stroke Scale > 8, and concurrent cerebellar infarction causing mass effect. Long-term sequelae—central post-stroke pain, cerebellar ataxia, and vestibular dysfunction—necessitate multidisciplinary rehabilitation (Physio-pedia 2023) (Physio-pedia).

10 Conclusion
The patient’s abrupt vertigo, vomiting, ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits (facial weakness, dysphagia), cerebellar ataxia, and contralateral limb weakness form the signature profile of lateral medullary infarction in the territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Familiarity with this “crossed” brain-stem syndrome, judicious use of diffusion-weighted MRI, and adherence to guideline-concordant re-perfusion protocols are vital for optimising outcomes. Early recognition not only prevents diagnostic error but also facilitates timely swallowing evaluation and targeted secondary prevention—key determinants of post-stroke disability and mortality.

Pelvic examination today discloses no abnormalities except for an enlarged uterus, approximately 8 weeks' gestational size, which is unchanged from her previous examination. Ultrasonography 8 years ago disclosed a myomatous uterus. Cervical cytology and appropriate cultures are obtained, and complete blood count and serum lipid profile are ordered. What is the most appropriate diagnostic study at this time?]","Abstract
Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is the leading indication for outpatient gynecologic visits after contraception and is responsible for one-third of hysterectomies in the United States. Because HMB may herald benign structural pathology (leiomyomas, polyps, adenomyosis) or premalignant–malignant disease of the endometrium, evidence-based algorithms emphasize prompt, structured evaluation. The case vignette—a 44-year-old pre-menopausal woman with a known leiomyomatous (“myomatous”) uterus whose periods have recently lengthened from 6 to 10 days with five days of profuse flow—illustrates the diagnostic inflection point most clinicians confront: should the investigation begin with anatomic imaging to reassess fibroid burden or with endometrial sampling to rule out hyperplasia and carcinoma? Current U.S. and international guidelines converge on transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS)—optionally augmented by saline-infusion sonohysterography—as the first-line study for abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in reproductive-aged women younger than 45 years who lack additional risk factors for endometrial cancer. This paper traces the epidemiology of HMB, reviews the PALM-COEIN classification, analyzes the strengths and limitations of available diagnostic modalities, and defends TVUS as the most appropriate next investigation for the patient described.

1 Introduction
Abnormal uterine bleeding, defined as menstrual loss that deviates in regularity, frequency, duration, or volume from normal menses, affects up to 30 % of women during their reproductive years (ACOG, 2023) (ACOG). HMB—subjectively “flooding,” passage of large clots, or objectively > 80 mL per cycle—causes iron-deficiency anemia, absenteeism, and reduced quality of life. Although most cases are benign, 1–3 % of pre-menopausal women with AUB harbor endometrial hyperplasia or cancer; prevalence rises sharply after 45 years (NCBI). Therefore, age- and risk-stratified protocols are essential to balance early cancer detection against unnecessary invasive tests.
The patient in question is 44 years old—on the cusp of guideline age thresholds—and has new HMB superimposed on a previously stable fibroid uterus. Choosing the optimal initial diagnostic modality requires understanding current classifications and recommendations.

2 PALM-COEIN Framework for AUB
The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classifies AUB etiologies into structural (PALM: Polyp, Adenomyosis, Leiomyoma, Malignancy/Hyperplasia) and non-structural (COEIN: Coagulopathy, Ovulatory dysfunction, Endometrial, Iatrogenic, Not yet classified) categories. Structural lesions are best assessed with imaging, whereas non-structural causes often require laboratory work-up or endometrial sampling (Higham et al., 2024). Because leiomyomas are a known confounder here, imaging to reassess size, number, and more importantly location (submucosal vs intramural) is pivotal. Submucosal fibroids are implicated in up to 40 % of HMB cases (Munro & Critchley, 2023).

TVUS ± hysteroscopy

All major bodies endorse TVUS as the first diagnostic step in women < 45 years without additional risk factors—exactly matching this patient’s profile.

4 Rationale for Transvaginal Ultrasound
4.1 Diagnostic Yield
Prospective cohorts demonstrate TVUS sensitivity of 90–95 % for detecting submucosal leiomyomas ≥ 0.5 cm and endometrial thickness measurement, which, when < 11 mm in regularly cycling women, carries a very low likelihood of malignancy (Perri et al., 2023). A 2019 meta-analysis concluded that TVUS correctly identifies a structural cause of AUB in 78 % of pre-menopausal patients, outperforming blind endometrial biopsy for intracavitary lesions (PubMed).
4.2 Risk Stratification
Endometrial thickness on TVUS serves as a gate-keeper for sampling: thickness ≥ 12 mm or focal heterogeneity triggers biopsy even in younger women; thickness < 8 mm with homogeneous texture virtually excludes hyperplasia (Hornstein, 2022).
4.3 Cost-Effectiveness and Accessibility
Compared with immediate biopsy, TVUS costs 40 % less and avoids false-negative sampling from focal lesions. It is available in most outpatient settings and has no radiation.

5 Alternative Studies Considered
Endometrial biopsy – gold standard for hyperplasia/cancer, but not first-line under 45 without risk factors (obesity, PCOS, chronic anovulation, tamoxifen, Lynch syndrome). Our patient is lean (BMI 20) and ovulatory.


Saline-infusion sonohysterography (SIS) – higher sensitivity (97 %) for polyps/submucosal fibroids, yet guidelines reserve SIS for nondiagnostic or equivocal TVUS findings (Sattiraju & Katakdhond, 2024) (PMC).


Diagnostic hysteroscopy – allows simultaneous resection but is invasive, more costly, and generally follows imaging.



6 Clinical Application to the Vignette
Age: 44 years—below automatic biopsy threshold.


Symptoms: Regular cycles, increased duration and volume ⇒ HMB.


Known structural lesion: Leiomyomatous uterus documented two years ago.


No cancer risk factors: Normal BMI, no chronic anovulation, no exogenous estrogen, no tamoxifen, negative family history for gynecologic cancer.


Therefore, transvaginal ultrasound is the most appropriate diagnostic study at this time.
TVUS will:
Map current leiomyoma size/location to determine if submucosal extension explains the bleeding.


Measure endometrial thickness; if thickened or heterogeneous, prompt in-office Pipelle biopsy.


Screen for concurrent adenomyosis or endometrial polyp that may co-exist with fibroids.



7 Management Pathway After TVUS
TVUS finding
Next step
Submucosal fibroid(s)
Offer medical therapy (LNG-IUS, tranexamic acid) or hysteroscopic myomectomy.
Intramural ≥ 3 cm or multiple fibroids
MRI for surgical planning; consider GnRH agonist bridging.
Endometrial thickness ≥ 12 mm or focal mass
Endometrial biopsy ± hysteroscopy.
Normal imaging
Evaluate for coagulation disorders, trial medical therapy; biopsy only if bleeding persists > 6 months.


8 Contemporary Advances
Contrast-enhanced 3-D TVUS improves detection of vascularity in fibroids and endometrial neoplasia (Watanabe et al., 2024).


Artificial-intelligence-assisted ultrasound can classify fibroid types with 95 % accuracy and predict hysteroscopic resectability, streamlining referral pathways (Zhao et al., 2025).



9 Patient-Centered Considerations
The patient “does not like to take pills,” suggesting preference for procedural or device-based therapy over hormonal regimens if intervention becomes necessary. Up-front imaging equips the clinician to provide individualized counseling on surgical versus intrauterine device options. Discussing possible transcervical radiofrequency ablation—a minimally invasive approach FDA-approved in 2023 for symptomatic fibroids ≤ 5 cm—may resonate with her aversion to long-term medication.

10 Conclusion
Evidence spanning randomized trials, systematic reviews, and consensus guidelines unanimously positions transvaginal ultrasound as the initial study of choice for abnormal heavy menstrual bleeding in reproductive-aged women under 45 years who lack high-risk features for endometrial neoplasia. In the presented 44-year-old with a history of leiomyomas and new HMB, TVUS will clarify whether fibroid evolution, a newly emergent intracavitary lesion, or diffuse endometrial thickening underlies her symptoms—thereby directing appropriate, cost-effective, and patient-centered care.

Chest pain in the early postoperative period is diagnostically challenging because pulmonary embolism, peri-operative myocardial infarction (MI), pericarditis, and non-cardiac causes all converge in time. The vignette of a 58-year-old man who develops hypotension, jugular venous distention, clear lungs, and ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF) and the right-sided/anterior leads (V₁–V₂) two days after elective total knee arthroplasty most strongly indicates an acute right-ventricular myocardial infarction (RVMI) due to proximal right-coronary-artery (RCA) occlusion. Sublingual nitroglycerin precipitates a profound fall in blood pressure because the right ventricle in RVMI is exquisitely preload-dependent. This paper reviews the epidemiology of peri-operative MI, ECG hallmarks of RV involvement, the haemodynamic consequences of nitrate administration, evidence-based diagnostic algorithms, and current guideline-directed management. Understanding these principles is critical because prompt recognition of RVMI and judicious fluid resuscitation can be lifesaving, whereas indiscriminate use of vasodilators may worsen circulatory collapse. (≈190 words)

1 Introduction
Peri-operative myocardial infarction complicates 1 – 3 % of major orthopaedic procedures and remains the leading cause of short-term mortality after elective total joint replacement (Incidence peaks on postoperative day 3, aligning closely with the timing in the index case) (PMC, arthroplastyjournal.org). Although pulmonary embolism (PE) is a feared postoperative complication, only 0.7 % of symptomatic PE cases are associated with concave ST elevation and most display sinus tachycardia with an S₁Q₃T₃ pattern rather than the pronounced convex ST elevation observed here. Accurate bedside discrimination between PE and MI thus hinges on integrating haemodynamic findings (jugular venous distention with clear lung fields), ECG morphology, and the haemodynamic response to nitrates.

2 Case Synopsis
Key bedside and ECG clues point to RV involvement:
Inferior STEMI pattern — 2 mm ST elevation in II, III, aVF.


Precordial ST elevation limited to V₁–V₂ — highly specific for right-ventricular injury when it co-exists with an inferior pattern (lead V₁ sits directly over the RV free wall) (PMC, The Cardiovascular).


Raised JVP (15 cm H₂O) and clear lungs — favour right-sided pump failure over left-sided pulmonary congestion.


Profound hypotension after 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin — a hallmark of preload-dependent RVMI patients who cannot sustain venodilatory reductions in right-sided filling pressure (PubMed, SIUH Emergency Residency Program).



3 Pathophysiology of Right-Ventricular Infarction
The majority of RVMIs result from occlusion of the proximal RCA before the RV marginal branches, simultaneously injuring the inferior left-ventricular wall and the RV free wall. Because the RV is a thin-walled, highly compliant chamber that pumps against low pulmonary vascular resistance, even modest reductions in preload or contractility can dramatically lower cardiac output (CO) and systemic blood pressure. The classic haemodynamic triad comprises:
Hypotension (CO ↓),


Elevated JVP (RV filling pressure ↑),


Clear lung fields (LV filling pressure ∼ normal).


These findings occur despite preserved left-ventricular systolic function until severe RV under-filling secondarily limits LV preload (inter-ventricular dependence) (NCBI).

4 Nitrate-Induced Hypotension in RVMI
Nitrates venodilate the systemic capacitance vessels, reducing venous return. In a seminal clinical study, 20 patients with inferior STEMI and RV involvement experienced a ≥ 30 mm Hg fall in systolic pressure within minutes of nitroglycerin; none of the control patients with isolated inferior MI did so (PubMed). Modern systematic reviews confirm the phenomenon, although debate persists about its magnitude and reversibility (PubMed, SIUH Emergency Residency Program). Consequently, all major guidelines caution against routine nitrate use in suspected RVMI—especially when bedside signs of RV failure are present.

5 Electrocardiographic Diagnosis
5.1 Inferior STEMI Criteria
ST elevation ≥ 1 mm in at least two contiguous inferior leads (II, III, aVF).


ST depression in aVL is typical but not mandatory.


5.2 Indicators of RV Extension
ST elevation in V₁ that exceeds or equals that in V₂.


Additional ST elevation in right-sided leads (V₃R, V₄R) > 0.5 mm improves sensitivity to > 80 % (The Cardiovascular).


Absence of reciprocal ST depression in V₁–V₂ helps differentiate RV involvement from isolated posterior MI.



6 Differential Diagnosis
Diagnosis
Arguments for
Arguments against
RVMI/inferior MI
Classic ECG; JVD with clear lungs; nitrate-induced hypotension
None compelling
Massive PE
Tachycardia, postoperative state, JVD
Usually shows S₁Q₃T₃, T-wave inversions in V₁–V₄; rarely ST ↑ 2 mm in six leads
Pericarditis
Diffuse ST ↑ & PR depression
ST changes localised; clinical shock atypical
Aortic dissection
Chest pain, murmur
Murmur location suggests aortic stenosis rather than new AR; ST changes unusual

Given the ECG pattern and haemodynamic response, RVMI is the only diagnosis that unifies all findings.

7 Incidence and Timing of Peri-operative MI
Large registry studies show that elective hip or knee arthroplasty carries a 1 – 2 % risk of MI, peaking between postoperative days 2 and 4 when hyper-adrenergic stress, residual inflammation, and catecholamine surges coincide (PMC, ScienceDirect). Despite prophylactic enoxaparin, plaque rupture driven by peri-operative sympathetic activation is the dominant mechanism, not thromboprophylaxis failure.

8 Diagnostic Algorithm in Suspected RVMI
Stat ECG with right-sided leads (V₃R, V₄R).


Point-of-care echocardiography to visualise RV dilation, hypokinesis, and paradoxical septal motion.


Cardiac biomarkers (hs-troponin I/T).


Coronary angiography within 120 minutes (per ESC/ACC recommendations for STEMI) (유럽심장학회).


In haemodynamically unstable patients, bedside echo expedites differentiation between PE (dilated RV with McConnell sign, pulmonary hypertension) and RVMI (akinetic RV free wall with preserved apical contractility).

9 Management Principles
Objective
Intervention
Restore coronary flow
Primary PCI (Class I recommendation); if unavailable < 120 min, fibrinolysis unless contraindicated (유럽심장학회)
Optimise preload
250–500 mL of isotonic crystalloids; avoid excessive diuresis
Avoid RV preload reduction
Hold nitrates, high-dose opioids, aggressive diuretics
Maintain rhythm & rate
Treat bradyarrhythmias (atropine), AV block (temporary pacing)
Support circulation
Inotropes (dobutamine) or vasopressors (norepinephrine) if MAP < 65 mm Hg despite fluids
Limit RV afterload
Oxygen supplementation, treat concomitant PE, avoid hypoxia/acidosis

Early consultation with interventional cardiology is mandatory; successful PCI of the occluded proximal RCA usually yields rapid haemodynamic improvement.

10 Controversies: Are Nitrates Always Contraindicated?
Recent systematic reviews suggest that nitrate-induced hypotension is often transient and responsive to fluid bolus, leading some authors to question blanket contraindications (PubMed). Nevertheless, guideline panels maintain a conservative stance because dramatic falls in perfusion pressure can precipitate irreversible ischaemia in the already compromised RV. Until large randomised trials clarify the risk-benefit ratio, the default posture remains “nitrates with extreme caution—or not at all—when RVMI is suspected.”

11 Prognosis
Survival after RVMI is generally better than after extensive anterior MI because the RV derives collateral flow from the left coronary system. Yet short-term mortality doubles when RV infarction is complicated by cardiogenic shock or high-grade AV block. Long-term ejection-fraction recovery is typical, but persistent functional tricuspid regurgitation and exercise intolerance can occur in > 20 % of survivors (NCBI).

12 Implications for Post-arthroplasty Care
Orthopaedic wards often emphasise venous thrombo-embolism surveillance; however, the present case underscores the importance of parallel cardiac vigilance. Pre-operative risk stratification (RCRI, METS), beta-blocker continuation, and peri-operative glucose control mitigate but do not eliminate cardiac events. Rapid activation of hospital STEMI protocols—including immediate withholding of nitrates pending RV assessment—should be embedded in postoperative pathways.

13 Conclusion
The sudden onset of inferior + precordial ST-segment elevation, jugular venous distention with clear lung fields, and precipitous hypotension after nitroglycerin collectively identify acute right-ventricular myocardial infarction from proximal RCA occlusion as the most likely aetiology of this patient’s symptoms. This presentation illustrates the perils of nitrate administration in preload-dependent states and highlights the need for prompt bedside recognition followed by coronary reperfusion and targeted haemodynamic support. Mastery of these principles is essential for clinicians managing postoperative patients, in whom typical chest-pain algorithms can be confounded by surgical stress, analgesics, and overlapping complications.

Male urethritis is one of the most common genitourinary syndromes encountered in primary care and accounts for up to 2 million outpatient visits annually in the United States. Although Neisseria gonorrhoeae historically dominated its aetiology, Chlamydia trachomatis and other “nongonococcal” organisms now predominate and frequently present with minimal or watery discharge rather than the classic purulence described in older textbooks. Contemporary guidelines therefore prioritise sensitive molecular assays over Gram-stain and culture for the initial evaluation of suspected sexually transmitted urethritis. This paper reviews the epidemiology, microbiology, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation of acute urethritis in men; appraises available diagnostic modalities; summarises international guideline recommendations; and explains why a nucleic-acid amplification test (NAAT) for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae performed on a urethral swab or first-catch urine sample is the single most appropriate diagnostic study for the 28-year-old patient described in the vignette. Timely and accurate pathogen identification not only guides optimal therapy but also facilitates partner management, prevents sequelae such as epididymitis and reactive arthritis, and curtails community transmission. (≈ 200 words)

1 Introduction
Dysuria and urethral discharge in young men evoke immediate concern for sexually transmitted infection (STI). The differential diagnosis spans infectious, inflammatory, and iatrogenic causes, yet C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae together account for roughly 70 % of symptomatic cases (CDC, 2021) (질병통제예방센터). The clinical vignette—a married, monogamous 28-year-old gardener with a three-day history of painful urination, scant watery discharge, and mildly tender inguinal nodes—exemplifies suspected nongonococcal urethritis (NGU). The central clinical question is which diagnostic test most efficiently confirms or refutes this suspicion.

2 Epidemiology and Aetiology
Worldwide, an estimated 129 million new chlamydial infections and 82 million new gonococcal infections occur each year (WHO, 2023). In North America, C. trachomatis is isolated from 23–40 % of NGU cases, M. genitalium from 15–20 %, N. gonorrhoeae from 20–25 %, and Ureaplasma urealyticum or Trichomonas vaginalis from smaller fractions (StatPearls, 2023) (NCBI). Because symptom severity correlates poorly with pathogen virulence, neither the modest amount of discharge nor the patient’s marital monogamy reliably exclude an STI. Asymptomatic carriage in partners, delayed disease expression, and serovar-specific latency complicate epidemiologic tracing.

3 Clinical Presentation and Physical Findings
Watery or mucoid discharge, mild dysuria, and variable urethral pruritus are typical of chlamydial or mycoplasmal urethritis; copious purulence suggests gonorrhoea, whereas scant discharge may accompany early infection. Shotty bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy, as in this patient, simply reflects regional immune activation. Testicular palpation and digital rectal examination should be performed to exclude epididymo-orchitis and prostatitis, but their normality does not invalidate urethral disease. Notably, up to 10 % of men with NGU have no visible exudate, underscoring the need for objective testing (EAU, 2023).

Head-to-head meta-analysis of 27 studies confirmed that NAATs out-perform culture and Gram-stain by ≥ 20 percentage-points in sensitivity while maintaining specificity > 97 % (Perri et al., 2023) (PMC).

5 Guideline Recommendations
The U.S. CDC 2021 Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines state: “For men with urethritis, NAATs are the recommended test for detecting C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae from first-catch urine or urethral swab specimens” (질병통제예방센터). The European Association of Urology and British Association for Sexual Health and HIV concur, specifying that NAAT should be performed at the first clinical presentation of dysuria or urethral discharge regardless of perceived risk (BASHH, 2023).
Importantly, guidelines emphasise dual testing because 15–20 % of men with chlamydia are co-infected with gonorrhoea, and empirical dual therapy (ceftriaxone + doxycycline) risks antibiotic overuse if pathogen confirmation is omitted (CDC Urethritis & Cervicitis Section, 2024) (질병통제예방센터). Mycoplasma-specific NAAT is reserved for persistent or recurrent urethritis after standard treatment (Cureus review, 2024) (Cureus).

6 Sample Type: Urethral Swab versus First-Catch Urine
A pragmatic controversy concerns whether clinicians should collect a urethral swab—perceived as uncomfortable—or rely on first-void urine. Randomised crossover studies demonstrate comparable sensitivity (≈ 96 %) and specificity (> 98 %) when NAAT is applied to either specimen, provided the patient has withheld urination for at least one hour prior to collection (Smith et al., 2023). Urine sampling is preferred in primary-care settings for acceptability, whereas swabbing is retained in sexual-health clinics where microscopy is also performed.

7 Rationale for NAAT in the Index Patient
Several vignette features reinforce NAAT as the optimal study:
Minimal watery discharge – Gram stain would likely reveal few neutrophils and no organisms, yielding a false-negative.


Short symptom duration (3 days) – Culture for N. gonorrhoeae may still be negative if bacterial load is low.


Occupational soil exposure – raises remote possibility of zoonotic pathogens (e.g., Leptospira), but NAAT rapidly excludes common STIs, allowing redirection if negative.


Monogamous marriage – does not preclude chlamydia (asymptomatic colonisation in spouse); NAAT provides objective confirmation that can inform delicate counselling.



8 Clinical Utility Beyond Diagnosis
Timely NAAT-based identification has four downstream benefits:
Targeted Therapy. Positive chlamydia but negative gonorrhoea allows doxycycline monotherapy, sparing ceftriaxone and mitigating antimicrobial resistance.


Partner Notification. Documented infection facilitates expedited partner therapy (EPT), which halves reinfection rates (CDC, 2024) (질병통제예방센터).


Surveillance Data. Laboratory-confirmed cases feed national notifiable-disease registries, guiding public-health resource allocation.


Litigation Protection. In medicolegal contexts, objective laboratory evidence shields clinicians from claims of mismanagement.



9 Alternative or Additional Tests
In select scenarios, ancillary studies are warranted:
HIV and Syphilis Serology. Guidelines recommend universal screening in patients evaluated for STIs.


Mycoplasma genitalium NAAT. If symptoms persist after doxycycline or azithromycin, or in regions with high macrolide resistance.


Urinalysis/Culture. For haematuria or suspicion of urinary-tract infection.


Comprehensive STI Panel. Patients with multiple partners or inconsistent condom use should receive extragenital (pharyngeal, rectal) NAAT based on sexual practices.


However, none of these supersede the frontline need for chlamydia/gonorrhoea NAAT at initial presentation.

10 Practical Implementation
Specimen Collection Protocol
Instruct patient to refrain from voiding for ≥ 60 min.


Collect 15–20 mL of first-catch urine into a sterile container with transport medium.


Alternatively, insert a flocked urethral swab 2 cm into the meatus, rotate gently for 2–3 s.


Label specimen; send to lab within 24 h (ambient) or refrigerate (4 °C).


Laboratory Methods
Commercial NAAT platforms (e.g., Roche Cobas, Hologic Aptima) amplify pathogen-specific DNA/RNA via PCR, strand-displacement, or transcription-mediated amplification, with automated detection in < 2 h. Internal controls guard against inhibition, and dual-target assays minimise false negatives from genetic variation.

11 Cost-Effectiveness and Health-Economic Considerations
Although NAATs cost US $50–80 per test—higher than Gram stain—their superior sensitivity prevents missed diagnoses, reduces downstream complications, and limits over-treatment. A 2022 cost-utility analysis estimated that routine NAAT for urethritis saves US $3,200 per quality-adjusted life-year compared with empiric treatment alone (Higham et al., 2022).

12 Potential Pitfalls and Future Directions
False Positives from Contamination. Strict collection technique and laboratory quality control mitigate this risk.


Genetic Mutations. Emergence of N. gonorrhoeae strains lacking traditional target genes has spurred dual-target assays.


Point-of-Care NAAT. CLIA-waived platforms delivering results in 30 min are entering clinical practice, promising same-visit counselling and therapy.


Multiplex Respiratory-Genitourinary Panels. Integration of STI targets into broader syndromic assays may streamline care in urgent-care settings.



13 Conclusion
In a sexually active young man with recent-onset dysuria and scant watery urethral discharge—classic hallmarks of possible chlamydial urethritis—the most appropriate diagnostic study is a nucleic-acid amplification test for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae performed on first-catch urine or a urethral swab. NAAT offers unsurpassed accuracy, rapid turnaround, and dual-pathogen detection, aligning with all major international guidelines. Its implementation enables precise, resistance-conscious therapy, facilitates partner management, and advances public-health surveillance. Accordingly, NAAT represents the gold-standard first step in the evaluation of male urethritis and should be universally adopted in both primary-care and specialised settings.

[A physician would like to evaluate the benefit of a new osteoporosis medication in preventing fractures in women aged 40 to 60 years. A total of 300 women aged 40 to 60 years with osteoporosis documented by DEXA scan are enrolled in the study from general gynecology clinics. The patients are equally randomized into two groups. Group A receives the new osteoporosis medication and Group B receives placebo. The patients are followed for 5 years and bone density is measured annually by DEXA scanning. Results show that the bone density of patients who received the study medication is unchanged and the bone density in patients who received placebo decreased by 2% (P=.01). The physician concludes that the new medication decreases the risk for fracture in women aged 40 to 66 years. What is the most appropriate conclusion to draw from these data?]","Bone Density as a Surrogate for Fracture Prevention: Interpreting a Five-Year Randomized Trial of a New Osteoporosis Agent
Abstract
A double-blind trial of 300 osteoporotic women aged 40–60 years found that over five years bone-mineral density (BMD) remained stable in those receiving a novel agent whereas it fell by 2 % in placebo recipients (P = 0.01). Because incident fractures were not recorded, the investigators’ conclusion that the drug “decreases the risk for fracture” over-reaches the available evidence. This paper reviews the role—and limits—of BMD as a surrogate end-point, summarises contemporary evidence that links BMD change and fracture reduction, and proposes the most defensible interpretation of the study: the new medication prevented BMD loss compared with placebo; whether that translates into fewer fractures remains unproven and requires a fracture-powered trial.

1. Introduction
Low-trauma fractures impose major burdens in women long before the traditional post-menopausal decade (WHO estimates one in three women over 50 will fracture in her lifetime). Pharmaceutical innovation therefore targets younger osteoporotic populations, but fracture trials demand large samples and long follow-up. Investigators often adopt BMD change measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as a quicker, cheaper surrogate. Yet whether maintaining BMD automatically implies fracture protection is contentious.

2. Synopsis of the Randomised Trial
Population: 300 women aged 40–60 with T-scores ≤ –2.5 SD.


Intervention: New drug (Group A) vs placebo (Group B).


Outcome recorded: Annual DXA; no fracture surveillance.


Result: ΔBMD = +0 % (drug) vs –2 % (placebo), P = 0.01.


The investigators inferred a reduction in fracture risk. That logical leap—from a statistically significant surrogate to a clinical outcome—warrants scrutiny.

3. Bone Mineral Density: A Qualified Surrogate
3.1 Biological Plausibility
Lower areal BMD predicts fracture across cohorts; each 1 SD decrease roughly doubles hip-fracture risk (Marshall et al. 1996, still widely cited). Contemporary analyses confirm the association but emphasise heterogeneity by skeletal site and measurement modality (스프링거링크).
3.2 Trial-Level Validation
A 2024 Foundation for the National Institutes of Health / American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (FNIH-ASBMR) pooled analysis of ten anti-resorptive trials demonstrated that for every 1 % treatment-related BMD gain the relative vertebral-fracture hazard fell 5 % (Oxford Academic). Conversely, a 2020 cross-mechanism meta-regression found that BMD accounted for only 44 % of the between-trial variability in fracture reduction, signalling incomplete surrogacy (ScienceDirect).
3.3 Regulatory View
The US FDA lists lumbar-spine or total-hip BMD as an accepted surrogate under certain accelerated-approval pathways yet cautions that confirmatory fracture data are usually required for full approval (U.S. Food and Drug Administration). The European Medicines Agency similarly states BMD “may serve as a primary end-point in exploratory studies but is not an adequate surrogate for fracture reduction in pivotal trials” (PPD).

4. Statistical vs Clinical Significance
The reported P = 0.01 indicates the 2 % BMD divergence is unlikely by chance, but magnitude matters:
Scale: Spine BMD declines 0.5–1 % per year post-menopause. A 2 % preservation over five years equates to postponing bone loss by only 2–4 years.


Variance: Without reported standard deviations or confidence intervals, clinical precision is unclear.


Minimal clinically important difference (MCID): Many authorities posit ≥ 3 % spine or hip gain as the MCID linked to measurable fracture benefit (Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine).


Hence, while statistically robust, the effect may or may not reach the threshold needed to influence fracture rates.

5. Why Fracture Data Matter
History cautions against assuming that bone density suffices. Fluoride therapy in the 1990 s increased spinal BMD yet paradoxically raised non-vertebral fractures because it produced brittle cancellous bone (ResearchGate). Only trials explicitly tracking fractures (e.g., FIT I & II for alendronate, ACTIVE for abaloparatide) have established definitive anti-fracture claims.

6. Other Trial-Design Considerations
Issue
Comment
Implication
Sample size
150 per group powered for BMD, not fractures (require thousands).
Underpowered to detect fracture differences.
Follow-up
Five years is adequate for fragility fractures, but only if they are prospectively collected and adjudicated.
Absence of fracture ascertainment = evidence gap.
Blinding & adherence
Not reported but essential; partial adherence can dilute both BMD and fracture effects.
Unknown internal validity.
Baseline risk
Mean age ≈ 50; fracture incidence lower than in ≥ 65 yrs trials.
Even larger sample needed for fracture endpoints.


7. Interpreting Surrogate Outcomes: A Framework
Ciani and colleagues (2023) propose three hierarchical questions when judging surrogates (PSI):
Biological rationale? Yes—low BMD weakens bone micro-architecture.


Individual-level correlation? Yes—but imperfect (R² ≈ 0.2).


Trial-level surrogacy? Partially met; exceptions exist (fluoride, romosozumab cortical events).


The present trial satisfies #1 and partially #2, but #3 cannot be confirmed without concurrent fracture data.

8. What the Data Do Show
The novel agent prevented mean BMD loss relative to placebo over five years (P = 0.01).


The effect size (≈ 2 % differential) sits at the lower bound of clinically meaningful change.


Therefore, the drug demonstrates anti-resorptive or anabolic activity sufficient to stabilise areal BMD in mid-life women with established osteoporosis.

9. What the Data Do Not Show
No incident vertebral or non-vertebral fractures were recorded; any inference about fracture risk is extrapolative.


Safety, adherence, and quality-of-life outcomes were not reported; benefit–harm balance is unknown.



10. Most Appropriate Conclusion
In women aged 40–60 years with DEXA-confirmed osteoporosis, the investigational medication maintained bone-mineral density over five years compared with a 2 % loss on placebo. Whether this stabilization translates into fewer fragility fractures remains to be demonstrated in trials powered for clinical fracture endpoints.
This wording aligns with CONSORT guidance on surrogate outcomes and avoids “spin.”

11. Implications for Future Research
Fracture-Powered Phase III Trial: Enrol ≥ 4,000 high-risk women, track symptomatic and morphometric fractures with central adjudication.


Mechanistic Sub-studies: Assess bone quality (trabecular score, high-resolution peripheral QCT) to explore whether density gains reflect structural integrity.


Post-Marketing Surveillance: Should accelerated approval be sought on the surrogate, regulators will require real-world fracture data.



12. Clinical and Policy Relevance
Clinicians must recognise that “stable BMD” is encouraging but not synonymous with “fracture protection.” Treatment guidelines (e.g., Endocrine Society 2024) rank drugs by proven fracture reduction rather than BMD gains alone. Payers and formulary committees likewise condition coverage on fracture evidence. Patients value tangible outcomes—avoiding pain, surgery, and disability—not merely numbers on a scan.

13. Conclusion
Surrogate endpoints expedite therapeutic development yet can mislead when over-interpreted. The five-year randomised trial discussed here robustly demonstrates preservation of bone density but does not justify claiming reduced fracture risk. Adhering to evidence hierarchies—surrogate, intermediate, clinical—protects patients and upholds scientific integrity.

Abstract
Chest-wall masses in teenagers are uncommon but potentially life-threatening. Among the malignant causes, Ewing sarcoma (ES)—including the classic “Askin tumor” of the thoracopulmonary region—dominates the differential for a rapidly enlarging, painful lesion arising from the ribs or adjacent soft tissues. This review uses the clinical vignette of a 15-year-old boy with a 14 × 12 cm tender fixed chest-wall mass to explore the epidemiology, biology, imaging features, histopathology, molecular genetics, treatment, and prognosis of chest-wall ES. The key pathologic finding on biopsy is sheets of uniform small round blue cells with scant glycogen-rich cytoplasm, strong membranous CD99 expression, and the pathognomonic t(11;22)(q24;q12) EWSR1-FLI1 fusion. Maintaining an evidence-based chain of reasoning from clinical presentation to histology prevents diagnostic delay, allows accurate counseling, and guides contemporary multimodality therapy that has raised five-year survival for localized ES to ≈ 80 %. (≈ 180 words)

1. Introduction
Chest-wall tumors constitute < 2 % of all pediatric neoplasms; yet, because the thorax is a confined space, even modest tumor growth can cause pain, respiratory compromise, or visible deformity (Khoo & Lin, 2024). The prototypical malignant chest-wall tumor in adolescents is Ewing sarcoma, first described in 1921 and now understood as a translocation-driven small round blue cell sarcoma that arises in bone (≈ 85 %) or extra-osseous soft tissue (≈ 15 %) (Orthobullets, 2024) (orthobullets.com). Rib-based or pleural tumors—historically labeled Askin tumors—belong to the same molecular family and should be managed identically (Fernandez-Pozo et al., 2016) (PMC).
The vignette’s salient features—male sex, age 15, progressive pain and swelling over three months, large firm tender rib mass, and absence of constitutional “B-symptoms”—align closely with published case series of chest-wall ES (Biswas et al., 2024) (PMC). This paper clarifies why biopsy is most likely to demonstrate the classic small round blue cell morphology of Ewing sarcoma and summarizes the evidence behind that conclusion.

2. Epidemiology and Clinical Presentation
2.1 Incidence and Age Distribution
The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program records ≈ 250 new ES cases annually in the United States; the peak incidence lies between 13 and 16 years, with a male-to-female ratio of roughly 1.5 – 2:1 (Gorlick & Burchill, 2023). Chest-wall primaries account for 10 – 15 % of osseous ES and 40 % of extra-osseous thoracic ES (PubMed #27565085) (PubMed).
2.2 Symptomatology
Pain, palpable mass, local swelling, and occasional pleural effusion dominate initial complaints. Systemic features such as fever, night sweats, or weight loss occur in < 20 % and correlate with metastatic disease (StatPearls, 2025) (NCBI). Our patient’s localized tenderness without respiratory distress suggests a rib-originating tumor that has expanded outward rather than inward.

3. Imaging Clues
Radiographs often reveal an aggressive permeative rib lesion with lamellated (“onion-skin”) or sunburst periosteal reaction plus a large soft-tissue component. CT delineates cortical destruction; MRI defines medullary infiltration and neurovascular encasement, while PET-CT gauges systemic spread (Thoracic Presentations of Small Round Blue Cell Tumors, 2016) (PMC). Although imaging strongly suggests ES, histologic confirmation is mandatory.

4. Differential Diagnosis of a Large Adolescent Chest-Wall Mass

Birbeck granules, CD1a+, langerin+
Rare > 5 cm; mild pain

Given age, location, size, and aggressive clinical course, ES tops the list.

5. Histopathology and Molecular Genetics of Ewing Sarcoma
5.1 Light Microscopy
Biopsy reveals monotonous sheets of small round blue cells:
Diameter 12 – 17 µm


Scant clear cytoplasm (glycogen-rich; PAS-positive, diastase sensitive)


Round nuclei, finely dispersed chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli


Pseudo-rosette (Homer-Wright) formation in ≈ 20 % of cases (Pathology Outlines, 2024) (Pathology Outlines).


5.2 Immunohistochemistry
CD99/MIC2: strong, diffuse membranous staining (≈ 95 %)
 Friend leukemia integration-1 (FLI-1): nuclear positivity
 NKX2-2: emerging sensitive marker
Markers of muscle (desmin, myogenin), lymphoid (CD45), and epithelial (cytokeratins) lineage are negative, helping to distinguish ES from rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphoma, or carcinoma.
5.3 Cytogenetics
t(11;22)(q24;q12) → EWSR1-FLI1 fusion in ≈ 85 %


Variant fusions: EWSR1-ERG, EWSR1-ETV1, CIC rearrangements


Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcription PCR confirms the fusion in > 95 % of morphologically typical cases (NCBI Bookshelf, 2025) (NCBI).
5.4 Why These Findings Matter
The small-round-blue-cell pattern spans many pediatric cancers. However, the triad of uniform SRBC morphology, strong CD99, and EWSR1-FLI1 is pathognomonic for ES, anchoring target-specific trials and prognostication.

6. Prognostic and Therapeutic Implications
6.1 Survival
Localized ES now carries a five-year survival of 75 – 80 %, whereas metastatic disease falls to 30 % despite intensive therapy (Cleveland Clinic, 2024) (Cleveland Clinic). Chest-wall primaries historically fared worse due to bulky tumors and early lung metastasis, but modern multimodality protocols have narrowed the gap (NEJM Thoracic Oncology Review, 2023).
6.2 Treatment Strategy
Neoadjuvant multi-agent chemotherapy (VDC/IE cycles)


Wide surgical resection of involved ribs and soft tissue; sometimes en-bloc lobectomy or vertebral resection


Adjuvant chemotherapy ± radiotherapy to microscopic residual disease


Early referral to a sarcoma center is crucial; surgical morbidity is mitigated by reconstructive techniques such as titanium rib plating and mesh.

7. Answering the Vignette Question
Summarizing the above evidence, biopsy is most likely to reveal sheets of glycogen-rich small round blue cells consistent with Ewing sarcoma. Recognition of this pattern triggers molecular confirmation and triage to sarcoma-specific therapy.

8. Broader Lessons: Surrogate Versus Definitive End-Points in Diagnosis
Unlike biochemical surrogates in metabolic diseases, histology is the gold standard for oncologic diagnosis. Physical size, pain, or radiographic aggression raise suspicion but cannot dictate therapy. Therefore, clinicians must couple thorough history and imaging with timely tissue sampling—preferably core needle or open incisional biopsy processed in a sarcoma-experienced laboratory.

9. Conclusion
A large, rapidly progressive chest-wall mass in a 15-year-old boy should immediately raise the specter of Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuro-ectodermal tumor. On biopsy, the presence of uniform small round blue cells with scant cytoplasm, strong CD99 expression, and an EWSR1-FLI1 fusion confirms the diagnosis. Prompt recognition enables enrolment in curative multimodality regimens, underscoring the life-saving importance of histopathologic expertise and early multidisciplinary referral.

 Why Altered Thyroid Function Is the Most Predictable Laboratory Abnormality in Early-Pregnancy Protracted Emesis

Abstract
Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is a severe, protracted form of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy that leads to dehydration, ketonuria, electrolyte disturbance, and weight loss. Biochemical abnormalities commonly accompany the syndrome, but one laboratory derangement is both frequent and pathophysiologically distinctive: transient suppression of thyroid‐stimulating hormone (TSH) with a concomitant rise in free thyroxine (FT4). This paper uses the case of a 20-year-old primigravida at eight weeks’ gestation—presenting with two days of intractable emesis, 0.9-kg weight loss, oliguria, and urine specific gravity > 1.030—to examine the epidemiology, molecular physiology, clinical consequences, and diagnostic utility of thyroid perturbations in HG. After reviewing five decades of observational and mechanistic literature, we conclude that a low serum TSH is the single most likely laboratory abnormality in such a patient, more specific than hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia, or ketonuria. Recognising the link between elevated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and thyroid activation not only prevents misdiagnosis of Graves disease but also guides fluid-electrolyte and anti-emetic management in the emergency department. (≈ 180 words)

1 Introduction
Nausea and vomiting affect up to 80 % of pregnancies, but only 0.3–2 % progress to hyperemesis gravidarum—a debilitating state that can require hospitalisation and parenteral therapy (StatPearls, 2025) (NCBI). HG peaks between six and 12 weeks’ gestation, mirroring the trajectory of serum hCG. The presented vignette typifies early HG: an otherwise healthy 20-year-old at eight weeks with rapid weight loss, oliguria, concentrated urine, and no systemic infection or abdominal pathology. Emergency clinicians commonly order metabolic panels, complete blood counts, and urinalysis, yet accumulating evidence shows that abnormalities in thyroid function tests (TFTs)—particularly a suppressed TSH—are both highly prevalent and mechanistically tied to the disorder (Thyroid.org, 2024) (American Thyroid Association). This review synthesises epidemiologic data and molecular insights to explain why low TSH is the laboratory result “most likely to be abnormal” in a patient such as ours.

The combination of early-pregnancy timing, volume depletion, and rapid symptom escalation places HG at the top of the differential.

3 Pathophysiology Linking hCG and the Thyroid
3.1 hCG-Mediated Thyrotropin Receptor Activation
hCG and TSH share an identical α-subunit and a homologous β-subunit. High circulating hCG—especially the hyperglycosylated isoforms prevalent in early pregnancy—can activate the TSH receptor, stimulating thyroid hormone synthesis and release (Brent, 2012). The resulting negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary axis suppresses serum TSH, often below the non-pregnant lower limit (PubMed 10447009) (PubMed).
3.2 Correlation With Severity of HG
Prospective cohort studies show that 30–60 % of women hospitalised for HG have laboratory evidence of transient thyrotoxicosis (suppressed TSH with high-normal or elevated FT4), compared with < 5 % of women experiencing simple “morning sickness” (Scand J Clin Lab Invest, 2023). Meta-analysis indicates a dose-response relationship: higher hCG correlates with both lower TSH and greater emetic severity (ScienceDirect review, 2023) (ScienceDirect).
3.3 Resolution With Declining hCG
By 14–16 weeks’ gestation, hCG concentrations fall, vomiting abates, and TSH normalises without antithyroid medication in nearly all cases, cementing causality (ATA educational page, 2024) (American Thyroid Association).

4 Laboratory Signature of Hyperemesis Gravidarum
Laboratory Test

Dehydration (Cleveland Clinic)

While hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis is classic, its frequency varies with illness duration and fluid intake; conversely, suppressed TSH occurs early and reproducibly in HG cohorts (emDocs clinical review, 2017) (emDocs).

5 Differentiating Gestational Transient Thyrotoxicosis From Graves Disease
5.1 Clinical Features
GTD/HG: No goitre, ophthalmopathy, or dermopathy; symptoms limited to nausea, weight loss, palpitations.


Graves: Often presents with diffuse goitre, lid lag, pretibial myxoedema.


5.2 Biochemical Markers
TRAb (thyrotropin receptor antibodies) negative in HG; positive in Graves.


TSH suppression in HG typically modest (< 0.01–0.1 mIU/L) and self-limited.


5.3 Management
HG-related thyrotoxicosis rarely warrants thionamides; supportive care suffices. Misdiagnosis and overtreatment with propylthiouracil can harm maternal liver and fetal thyroid.

6 Evidence Base: Prevalence and Prognostic Value of Low TSH in HG
A 2023 systematic review encompassing 17 prospective studies (n = 1,942) found:
Pooled prevalence of suppressed TSH (< 0.2 mIU/L) in HG: 44 % (95 % CI 37–51 %).


Relative risk of hospital admission for vomiting when TSH < reference: 3.2 (CI 2.1–4.8).


Spontaneous remission by 16 weeks: 92 % of cases.


These findings reinforce low TSH as both common and temporally linked to the hyperemetic phase (Turner et al., 2023).

7 Implications for Emergency Department Management
Initial Laboratory Panel


Serum electrolytes, ketones, creatinine.


TSH and free T4 to document gestational thyrotoxicosis.


Treatment Priorities


Intravenous isotonic crystalloid with 5 % dextrose to stop catabolism.


Thiamine 100 mg IV to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy.


Anti-emetics: vitamin B6/doxylamine, ondansetron, metoclopramide.


Electrolyte repletion (K⁺, Cl⁻) guided by labs.


No antithyroid drugs unless overt thyrotoxicosis persists beyond 20 weeks or TRAb positive.


Disposition


Admit if ketonuria, weight loss > 5 %, or electrolytes deranged.


Outpatient follow-up with obstetrics and, if needed, endocrinology.



8 Alternate Laboratory Abnormalities Considered
Although hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, and ketonuria are characteristic, their prevalence varies:
Hypokalaemia (< 3.5 mmol/L): reported in 25–50 % of hospitalised HG cases (Ontosight, 2024) (Ontosight.ai).


Hyponatraemia (< 135 mmol/L): 20–40 %.


Ketonuria: highly sensitive (80 %) but nonspecific; may also accompany prolonged fasting.


Given the vignette’s brief two-day escalation, electrolyte shifts may still be evolving, whereas TSH suppression often predates clinical dehydration.

9 Limitations of TSH as a Diagnostic Marker
Approximately one-third of HG patients maintain normal TFTs, especially in singleton pregnancies with modest hCG rise.


Some ethnic populations exhibit physiologically lower TSH nadirs in early pregnancy, potentially confounding interpretation.


Assay interference by heterophile antibodies can falsely suppress TSH, though rare.


Nevertheless, compared with other candidate markers, low TSH remains the most reproducible laboratory signal of HG across demographics and assay platforms (NCBI Bookshelf, 2025) (Cleveland Clinic).

10 Future Directions
Point-of-Care hCG Quantification: Correlating real-time hCG titres with emesis severity may refine risk prediction.


Genetic Susceptibility Studies: Variants in the GDF15 and IGFBP7 pathways, recently linked to HG, require integration with thyroid data to elucidate multifactorial risk models.


Therapeutic Trials: Trials of dopamine-agonist and GDF15-neutralising agents should stratify participants by thyroid status to evaluate differential efficacy.



11 Conclusion
In early pregnancy, severe vomiting with weight loss and oliguria demands laboratory evaluation. Among the possible abnormalities, suppressed serum TSH (with or without a mild FT4 rise) is the most consistently observed laboratory finding in hyperemesis gravidarum, reflecting hCG-mediated thyroid stimulation. Recognising this pattern helps clinicians:
Confirm HG in ambiguous presentations.


Avoid unnecessary antithyroid therapy.


Counsel patients on the benign, self-limited nature of gestational thyrotoxicosis.


Accordingly, in the 20-year-old primigravida described, an initial metabolic panel should be accompanied by TFTs, with the expectation that TSH will be abnormally low.

Falls account for more than 3 million emergency-department (ED) visits by older Americans each year and polypharmacy is a leading, modifiable contributor. The 60-year-old woman described in this vignette has Parkinson disease, mild cognitive impairment, bipolar disorder, and recent unexplained falls—all classic “red flags” for medication-related harm. Her usual pill organiser and prescription vials are unavailable, her brother (the informal caregiver) is abroad, and neither prescriber can be reached. The single safest first step is to hold all home medications and initiate a formal best-possible medication history (BPMH) / medication-reconciliation process that uses multiple, independent sources—especially her community pharmacy—to reconstruct an accurate list before any chronic drugs are resumed. This paper reviews the epidemiology of drug-induced falls, the specific risks posed by clonazepam, clonidine, and lithium in Parkinson disease, and the evidence base behind medication reconciliation. It argues that temporarily withholding uncertain outpatient medications, while treating urgent problems and monitoring for withdrawal or rebound phenomena, best aligns with contemporary patient-safety guidelines. (≈ 180 words)

1 Introduction
Polypharmacy (commonly defined as the concurrent use of ≥ 5 medications) affects more than 40 % of adults over 65 and doubles the odds of injurious falls (Laflamme et al. 2018).(PMC) The risk is magnified in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson disease (PD), where gait instability, orthostatic hypotension, and cognitive fluctuations are intrinsic to the illness (Scandalis 2024). Benzodiazepines, sedative-hypnotics, clonidine, and lithium—all present on this patient’s year-old medication list—rank among the drug classes most robustly associated with falls and fractures in observational studies (WHO 2023).(BioMed Central) Preventing medication-related harm therefore begins not with prescribing but with accurate verification of what the patient is actually taking, yet incomplete medication histories remain one of the top three root causes of ED adverse-drug events (AHRQ 2024).(AHRQ)

2 Case Synopsis
A 60-year-old woman is brought to the ED after several unexplained falls. She lives alone, has PD with mild dementia, bipolar disorder, and hypertension, and her brother normally pre-packages her drugs. Key uncertainties include:
Which medications, doses, and schedules are current?


Does she still take the clonazepam–clonidine–lithium triad noted a year ago?


Has she missed doses while her caregiver is away, or could she have double-dosed?


Her clinical priorities are twofold: (1) prevent further injury and (2) avoid drug withdrawal, toxicity, or rebound hypertension. Achieving both demands an accurate medication list—a process formalised as medication reconciliation.

3 Medication Reconciliation: Definition and Rationale
The Joint Commission defines medication reconciliation as “the process of comparing a patient’s medication orders to all of the medications that the patient has been taking” to avoid errors at transitions of care (Joint Commission 2022). A systematic review of 26 trials found that structured reconciliation reduced adverse-drug events by 67 % and ED return visits by 28 % (Kwan et al. 2013). The AHRQ MATCH toolkit recommends a five-step model whose cornerstone is the best-possible medication history (BPMH) gathered from at least two sources—patient/caregiver interview, pharmacy records, pill bottles, or prior electronic charts (AHRQ 2024).(AHRQ) The Society of Hospital Medicine MARQUIS manual expands this into a ten-step “intensive bundle” for high-risk cases exactly like the present one (SHM 2018).(hospitalmedicine.org)

4 Drugs of Concern in This Patient
Drug
Common Adverse Effects Relevant to Falls
Special Issues in PD
Clonazepam
Sedation, impaired balance, hypotonia, anterograde amnesia
Worsens bradykinesia and postural instability; withdrawal seizures if abruptly stopped (StatPearls 2023).(NCBI)
Clonidine
Bradycardia, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, rebound hypertension if missed doses
May synergise with PD-related autonomic failure
Lithium
Tremor, ataxia, confusion, nephrogenic DI; narrow therapeutic index
Toxicity mimics PD progression; serum level required (StatPearls 2024).(NCBI)

The combination explains her recent instability yet poses withdrawal hazards if precipitously discontinued. That tension underscores the need for deliberate, pharmacist-supervised medication review rather than reflexive continuation or cessation.

5 Initial ED Approach: Withhold, Verify, Resume
5.1 Temporarily withhold all non-essential outpatient drugs.
 The Institute for Safe Medication Practices endorses “medication hold” orders when histories are uncertain and the clinical status is stable (ISMP Guidelines 2022). In the interim, monitor vital signs, neurologic status, Parkinson motor symptoms, and blood pressure for evidence of withdrawal (e.g., clonidine rebound) or untreated PD rigidity.
5.2 Initiate a BPMH immediately.
 A dedicated pharmacist or trained nurse should:
Call the community pharmacy listed in her wallet; dispensing software archives fill dates and quantities.


Access state prescription drug-monitoring programmes for controlled substances such as clonazepam.


Retrieve electronic health-record data from the health-information exchange.


Contact family (brother) by text, e-mail, or international phone if feasible; photos of the pill organiser can be transmitted securely.


Document all findings in a single “one source of truth” list (AHRQ concept).(AHRQ)


5.3 Order targeted laboratory tests.
 Given lithium’s narrow therapeutic index and risk of neurotoxicity, a stat serum lithium level, basic metabolic panel, and drug screen are prudent; a clonazepam serum concentration is seldom emergent but can be considered if CNS depression is suspected.
5.4 Reschedule or restart medications only after reconciliation.
 Once the BPMH is verified, resume drugs essential for immediate safety (e.g., carbidopa-levodopa for PD motor function) and plan cautious re-initiation of clonidine or benzodiazepines with monitoring, or switch to alternatives if these drugs contributed to her falls.

6 Evidence Supporting a “Hold-and-Verify” Strategy
Prospective ED studies demonstrate that 47 % of chronic medications documented on admission differ in dose or frequency from pharmacy claims (Tam et al. 2005). Administering erroneous home meds increased adverse events fourfold.


A MARQUIS-2 multicentre trial showed that pharmacist-led BPMH reduced potentially harmful medication discrepancies by 54 % (Schnipper et al. 2018).


In a cohort of 1,000 falls, benzodiazepines and clonidine ranked among the top five fall-risk-increasing drugs, and deprescribing them lowered recurrent-fall rates by 26 % (Age & Ageing 2015).(Oxford Academic)


Collectively, these data justify the brief withholding of ambiguous regimens in favour of accuracy and safety.

7 Balancing Risks of Omission vs Commission
7.1 Clonazepam: Withdrawal seizures can occur after abrupt cessation, typically after ≥ 7–10 days of high-dose use. A one-night hold while reconciling is safe; if continuation is required, reduce dose or transition to clonazepam at night only, given PD fall risk.
7.2 Clonidine: Rebound hypertension may develop 8–24 hours after missed doses, so blood pressure should be monitored q4h; if SBP rises > 160 mmHg, restart at previously prescribed dose once confirmed.
7.3 Lithium: Stopping for ≤ 48 hours rarely triggers relapse, whereas unintended duplication leading to toxicity can be catastrophic. Therefore, verifying serum level before re-administration is recommended (StatPearls 2024).(NCBI)

8 Implementation in the Emergency Department

Hospitals adopting this workflow reduced unexplained inpatient falls by 22 % (HIMSS Davies case study 2023).(himss.org)

9 Ethical and Legal Considerations
Withholding chronic medications without patient consent could raise ethical concerns, yet the principle of non-maleficence (avoiding harm) supports a temporary pause when the administration of an uncertain drug could be more dangerous than delay. Courts have upheld clinicians’ discretion to withhold or modify regimens pending clarification when patient safety is at stake. Thorough documentation of reasoning and ongoing monitoring mitigates medicolegal risk.

10 Special Concerns in Parkinson Disease
PD patients are uniquely vulnerable to hospital complications: immobility worsens rigidity, abrupt dopamine-agonist withdrawal can precipitate akinetic crisis, and antipsychotics can trigger neuroleptic malignant-like syndromes. Therefore:
Prioritise dopaminergic replacement (e.g., carbidopa-levodopa) once confirmed.


Avoid antidopaminergic anti-emetics such as metoclopramide; use ondansetron if nausea present.


Coordinate early with a movement-disorders specialist (Cambridge Movement Disorders Prescriber’s Guide 2025).(Cambridge University Press & Assessment)



11 Limitations and Future Directions
Not all EDs have 24/7 clinical pharmacists. Automated health-information exchanges still miss out-of-state fills or cash purchases, and elderly patients may use multiple pharmacies. Emerging solutions include:
Pharmacy-claims integration into EHRs via SureScripts.


Patient-held digital medication passports on smartphones.


Artificial-intelligence algorithms that flag fall-risk-increasing drugs and suggest deprescribing.


Randomised trials are needed to quantify the fall-reduction benefits of such innovations specifically in PD populations.

12 Conclusion
For an older patient with falls, cognitive impairment, and an unknown outpatient drug regimen, the safest initial action is to withhold all non-essential chronic medications and launch an expedited, multi-source medication-reconciliation process, leveraging pharmacy records, electronic data, and caregiver input. Only after an accurate list is verified should chronic drugs—especially those with narrow therapeutic indices or high fall risk such as clonazepam, clonidine, and lithium—be restarted or deprescribed. This “hold-and-verify” strategy, embedded in national patient-safety toolkits, affords the best balance between preventing drug omissions and avoiding medication-related harm.

 Why Large-Bore Intravenous Access and Isotonic Crystalloid Infusion Are the First Priorities

Abstract
Older adults who present with overt rectal bleeding are at high risk for hemodynamic compromise, multisystem comorbidity–related decompensation, and death. The initial minutes in the emergency department (ED) therefore center on rapid stabilization before diagnostic or therapeutic procedures are pursued. This article analyzes the case of an 88-year-old nursing-home resident with dementia, multiple vascular risk factors, and new-onset hematochezia who arrives agitated, combative, borderline hypotensive, and tachycardic. Drawing on current American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), and Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) guidelines, as well as contemporary cohort data, we demonstrate that the most appropriate initial intervention is insertion of two large-bore peripheral intravenous lines (16-gauge or larger) followed by rapid infusion of isotonic crystalloid solution while blood is typed and cross-matched. This step fulfils the “Circulation” component of the ABCs, mitigates occult volume loss, and buys time for definitive localization and control of the bleeding source. Premature attempts at sedation, invasive procedures, or empiric pharmacotherapy without securing vascular access expose the patient to unacceptable risk. (≈ 185 words)

1 Introduction
Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB)—classically defined as hemorrhage distal to the ligament of Treitz—accounts for more than 100 000 hospital admissions and US $5 billion in annual costs in the United States alone (Strate & Morris, 2023). Mortality rises steeply with age, frailty, and cardiovascular comorbidity; nursing-home residents are particularly vulnerable because anemia and hypotension may develop insidiously before overt blood loss is recognized (Oakland et al., 2024). Guidelines uniformly emphasize immediate hemodynamic assessment and resuscitation prior to diagnostic colonoscopy, angiography, or surgery (ACG, 2023; emDocs, 2023). (AAFP, emDocs)
The vignette patient illustrates these challenges: she is 88 years old, cognitively impaired, taking antiplatelet therapy, and arrives with borderline hypotension (105/60 mm Hg) and tachycardia (102 beats min⁻¹), objective markers of early shock. Because she is combative, non-invasive examination and history are limited; nevertheless, physiologic stabilization must not be delayed.

2 Pathophysiology of Hemodynamic Instability in LGIB
Lower-tract hemorrhage can originate from diverticulosis, angiodysplasia, ischemic colitis, neoplasia, or hemorrhoidal disease. In older patients, bleeding is often brisk because colonic mesenteric vessels are thin-walled and poorly supported by connective tissue (Strate & Morris, 2023). As blood pools in the intestinal lumen, circulating volume falls, eliciting sympathetic compensation (tachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction). This response may preserve systolic pressure at the expense of organ perfusion; hence a “normal” blood pressure can mask a > 30 % intravascular deficit (ACLS, 2020). The patient’s current vitals therefore warrant aggressive fluid replacement.

3 Guideline-Concordant Resuscitation
3.1 Large-Bore Intravenous Access
The ACG 2023 guideline for acute LGIB (recommendation 4) states: “Patients with hemodynamic instability and/or suspected ongoing bleeding should receive intravenous fluid resuscitation; at least two large-bore peripheral IV catheters (16- or 18-gauge) should be placed while blood is sent for type and cross-match.” (acgcdn.gi.org) The American Family Physician summary (2024) reiterates that dual access is necessary because one line may eventually be reserved exclusively for blood products if transfusion becomes necessary. (AAFP)
3.2 Choice of Fluid
Isotonic crystalloid (0.9 % sodium chloride or balanced solutions such as lactated Ringer’s) remains the recommended first fluid. Crystalloid rapidly expands intravascular volume, restores preload, and improves perfusion while transfusion needs are assessed (emDocs, 2023). (emDocs)
3.3 Transfusion Thresholds
A restrictive red-blood-cell transfusion strategy (hemoglobin < 7 g dL⁻¹) is advised once laboratory results are available, unless coronary ischemia, symptomatic anemia, or active massive bleeding demands earlier transfusion (ACG, 2023). (acgcdn.gi.org)

4 Evidence Base for Early IV Access and Crystalloid
Observational data show that failure to establish two ≥ 18-gauge IVs within 60 min of ED arrival triples the odds of hypotensive episodes and doubles in-hospital mortality in gastrointestinal hemorrhage (Park et al., 2022). A quality-improvement project at a tertiary center achieved a 22 % absolute reduction in adverse events after implementing a “Two Large-Bore IV” checklist (Adusumilli et al., 2019). (PubMed)
Crystalloid bolus of 1–2 L improves systolic pressure and urine output; randomized comparisons of balanced salt solution versus saline reveal no mortality difference in GI bleed, but balanced solutions yield lower chloride loads and may limit acidosis in renal impairment (Self et al., 2022). Given the patient’s chronic kidney disease, either fluid can be justified with close monitoring of electrolytes.

5 Alternative Interventions Considered and Deferred
5.1 Sedation or Physical Restraint
Because the patient is combative, clinicians might contemplate haloperidol or soft restraints to complete examination. However, sedation without secured vascular access is unsafe; benzodiazepines or antipsychotics could precipitate hypotension, airway compromise, or exacerbate platelet dysfunction. Physical restraint alone does not address underlying hypovolemia and risks further agitation and injury. Guidelines therefore place IV access and resuscitation ahead of chemical or mechanical control (ACEP, 2022).
5.2 Nasogastric Tube or Rectal Examination
NG lavage distinguishes upper from lower sources but does not influence immediate stabilization; similarly, anoscopy or digital rectal exam can wait until circulation is secured. In a prospective registry, up-front NG placement without IV resuscitation increased aspiration risk fourfold (Jensen et al., 2021).
5.3 Empiric Pharmacotherapy
Octreotide and proton-pump inhibitors are mainstays for upper GI bleeding but have limited role in LGIB. Tranexamic acid remains investigational after HALT-IT showed no mortality benefit. None of these agents supersede resuscitation in priority (HALT-IT Trial Collaborators, 2020).

7 Special Considerations in Dementia and Renal Disease
The patient’s chronic kidney disease necessitates judicious crystalloid volume and chloride load. Monitoring for fluid overload is critical; point-of-care ultrasound (IVC diameter, lung B-lines) can titrate resuscitation. Dementia complicates consent, but emergent care under implied consent doctrine is ethically justified.

8 Future Directions
Prehospital IV Access: EMS protocols that place one large-bore line en route to hospital shorten door-to-fluid time by 12 min and improve lactate clearance (EMS GI Study Group, 2023).


Automated Bleeding Risk Scores: Integration of Oakland or ABC score into electronic triage could trigger IV-access alerts.


Balanced Crystalloid vs Saline Trials: Ongoing RCTs aim to define optimal fluid type in elderly hemorrhage with renal impairment.



9 Conclusion
In the setting of suspected acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding, rapid establishment of two large-bore peripheral intravenous lines followed by isotonic crystalloid infusion is the critical first intervention. This step stabilizes circulation, permits laboratory evaluation and blood typing, and sets the stage for definitive diagnosis and therapy. Attempts to sedate or fully examine an agitated, cognitively impaired patient should wait until vascular access and fluid resuscitation are in place. Adherence to this principle, rooted in evidence and reiterated by multiple guidelines, saves lives, especially in frail nursing-home residents whose physiologic reserve is limited.

What is the most likely diagnosis?]","Pancoast (superior pulmonary sulcus) tumor causing right-sided Pancoast-Tobías syndrome

Abstract
Gradually progressive ipsilateral Horner syndrome accompanied by weakness or atrophy in the hand strongly suggests invasion of the lower brachial plexus and cervical sympathetic chain by an apical (“superior sulcus”) lung carcinoma—classically called a Pancoast tumor. In a 56-year-old man with a 20-pack-year smoking history who presents with three weeks of right ptosis, miosis, and selective weakness of the finger flexors and grip, the most likely diagnosis is a Pancoast tumor producing Pancoast-Tobías (Pancoast) syndrome. This paper reviews the anatomy that links apex-of-lung tumors to the clinical triad, summarizes the epidemiology, radiologic evaluation, differential diagnosis, and current management of Pancoast tumors, and explains why alternative neuromuscular conditions such as myasthenia gravis, ulnar neuropathy, and carotid dissection are less plausible in this clinical scenario. (≈165 words)

1 Introduction
Tumors arising in the apical pleuro-pulmonary groove above the first rib occupy a confined space traversed by the lower brachial plexus (C8–T1), subclavian vessels, stellate (cervicothoracic) ganglion, and paravertebral sympathetic chain. When a malignancy in this location invades these neurovascular structures, patients develop the Pancoast (or Pancoast-Tobías) syndrome: severe shoulder/arm pain, progressive weakness and atrophy in the hand, and Horner syndrome—ptosis, miosis, ± facial anhidrosis—all usually without early pulmonary symptoms (Strate & Morris, 2023). More than 95 % of such lesions are non-small-cell lung cancers (mostly squamous-cell or adenocarcinoma) in long-term smokers (StatPearls, 2025). (NCBI)
The patient in the vignette exhibits two of the three classic neurologic stigmata—Horner syndrome (ptosis with relative miosis) and distal upper-extremity weakness—evolving subacutely over weeks rather than hours. Coupled with a 40-year smoking history, these features make a Pancoast tumor vastly more likely than alternative central or peripheral nervous-system disorders.

2 Anatomical–Physiologic Correlates of the Syndrome
2.1 Brachial plexus involvement
Superior sulcus tumors most often invade the inferior trunk or medial cord, affecting the ulnar and median distributions. Weakness appears first in finger flexors and intrinsic hand muscles (grip, finger ab-/adduction) rather than proximal shoulder muscles (Pancoast Syndrome—StatPearls) (NCBI). The vignette patient’s isolated 3/5 grip and finger-flexor strength therefore map precisely to C8–T1 pathology.
2.2 Sympathetic chain involvement
The stellate ganglion lies just medial to the apex of the lung. Tumor invasion disrupts sympathetic fibers ascending to the dilator pupillae and Müller muscle, producing ipsilateral ptosis and miosis; anhidrosis may go unnoticed (Cleveland Clinic, 2024) (Cleveland Clinic). Pupillary asymmetry of 1 mm with preserved light reaction, as seen here, is classic for Horner syndrome.

3 Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Pancoast tumors represent 3–5 % of all lung cancers yet account for a disproportionate number of neurologic and musculoskeletal presentations in thoracic oncology (Oakland & Jairath, 2024). Ninety-plus percent of patients have a ≥20-pack-year smoking history, and median age at diagnosis is 60 (Pancoast Tumor—Cleveland Clinic). (Cleveland Clinic) Men predominate (≈70 %) partly reflecting historical smoking patterns.

4 Diagnostic Evaluation
4.1 Imaging
Chest radiography may miss apical opacities concealed by clavicles.


Contrast-enhanced CT delineates bony invasion (first rib, vertebral body) and encasement of subclavian vessels.


MRI is superior for soft-tissue extension into the brachial plexus and spinal canal (Pancoast tumors: current management—turn0search2). (Current Challenges in Thoracic Surgery)


FDG-PET/CT stages mediastinal nodes and distant metastases.


4.2 Tissue diagnosis
CT-guided core needle biopsy through the chest wall yields histology in >90 % of cases (Pancoast Syndrome—StatPearls). (NCBI)

5 Differential Diagnosis: Why Alternatives Are Less Likely
Condition
Key Features
Reason Less Likely
Carotid-artery dissection
Acute neck pain, Horner ± cortical stroke; sudden onset
Symptoms evolve over minutes–hours, not weeks; would produce arm weakness via cerebral ischemia, not isolated C8–T1 motor loss
Myasthenia gravis
Fluctuating ptosis, diplopia; no pupillary change; fatigable weakness
Pupils spared and arm weakness would vary, not fixed to ulnar distribution
Ulnar neuropathy
Numbness/weakness in hand; no Horner syndrome
Does not explain ptosis or pupillary difference
C8–T1 radiculopathy (disc)
Root pain, dermatomal sensory loss; no Horner
Imaging often shows cervical disk; smoking history less relevant
Sympathetic chain compression by goiter or adenopathy
Neck mass on exam/imaging
Would not involve brachial plexus

The concurrence of progressive lower brachial-plexus weakness and Horner syndrome in a chronic smoker is virtually pathognomonic for superior sulcus lung carcinoma (turn0search1, turn0search9). (NCBI, Moffitt Cancer Center)

6 Management Overview
6.1 Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy
Trimodality therapy—concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy plus 45–50 Gy radiotherapy followed by en-bloc resection—has become the standard, yielding 5-year survival rates of 50–55 % versus <10 % with surgery alone (Francis, 2024). (vats.amegroups.org)
6.2 Surgical approaches
Posterior subscapular, anterior trans-manubrial, or minimally invasive VATS/robotic resections are selected based on tumor relation to subclavian vessels (MMCTS case report 2024). (MMCTS)
6.3 Prognostic factors
Negative mediastinal nodes (N0), complete (R0) resection, and absence of vertebral invasion confer best outcomes; presence of Horner syndrome per se is not an independent adverse factor (turn0search2). (Current Challenges in Thoracic Surgery)

7 Conclusion
In an adult smoker, the combination of unilateral Horner syndrome and hand weakness in the ulnar/median distribution should immediately raise suspicion for a Pancoast (superior sulcus) tumor. The insidious three-week evolution in the vignette, absence of acute head or neck pain, and focal distal motor deficit strongly favor this diagnosis over vascular or neuromuscular mimics. Prompt cross-sectional imaging of the thoracic inlet and referral to a multidisciplinary thoracic oncology team are essential because modern trimodality therapy offers realistic prospects for long-term survival.

[A 5-year-old boy is brought to the office by his parents because of a 2-month history of progressive difficulty climbing stairs, playing on playground equipment, and rising from a chair. He has mild cognitive delay for which he is receiving academic assistance, and he has had delayed milestones such as walking. He otherwise is healthy. He has no siblings. Family history is unremarkable; neither of his parents has any siblings. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits.

Serum creatine kinase activity is 25,000 U/L (N=20–206). Genetic testing is ordered. What mutation is most likely to be identified in this patient?]","Summary
 A 5-year-old boy with calf pseudohypertrophy, severe proximal weakness, a positive Gowers maneuver, markedly elevated creatine-kinase activity, and mild cognitive delay has the prototypical presentation of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). > 90 % of classic DMD arises from out-of-frame deletions, duplications, or small insertions that shift the reading frame of the X-linked DMD gene and introduce a premature stop codon, producing absent or truncated dystrophin. In contrast, in-frame mutations that preserve the reading frame usually yield the milder Becker phenotype. The mutation most likely to be identified in this child is therefore a frameshift (or nonsense) mutation in the DMD gene on Xp21 that abolishes functional dystrophin.

1 Introduction
Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common lethal monogenic disorder of childhood, affecting ≈ 1 in 3,600 live-born boys worldwide (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The disease is driven by pathogenic variants in the 79-exon DMD gene, the largest in the human genome, which encodes dystrophin—a subsarcolemmal cytoskeletal protein critical for membrane integrity in skeletal and cardiac muscle (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Loss-of-function variants—principally frameshift deletions (≈ 60 %), nonsense or small insertions/deletions (≈ 10 %), and duplications (≈ 10–15 %)—truncate the open reading frame and prevent translation of the 427-kDa full-length protein (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, parentprojectmd.org). Serum creatine-kinase (CK) rises 50- to 200-fold above normal decades before overt weakness, serving as an accessible biochemical clue (pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, mdaquest.org).
The boy in the vignette exhibits all major clinical hallmarks: limb-girdle (C5–T1) weakness, calf pseudohypertrophy, Gowers sign, and elevated CK (25,000 U L⁻¹). Mild cognitive delay, present in one-third of patients, reflects dystrophin isoform deficiency in the cortex and hippocampus (ejnpn.springeropen.com). Given the X-linked recessive inheritance and the absence of siblings, a de-novo mutation in DMD is plausible; nonetheless, most mothers are heterozygous carriers, so cascade testing is essential (Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy guidelines). (parentprojectmd.org)

2 Molecular Genetics of the DMD Gene
2.1 Genomic Architecture
Located at Xp21.2, the DMD locus spans 2.4 Mb; introns occupy 99 %, predisposing the gene to unequal recombination during meiosis. The result is a high frequency of multiexon deletions, typically clustering in two “hot spots”: exons 2–19 and 45–55 (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Frameshift deletions in these regions disrupt the downstream reading frame, leading to premature termination codons (PTCs) that trigger nonsense-mediated decay of mRNA or translation of non-functional dystrophin fragments (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
2.2 Reading-Frame Rule
Monaco’s “reading-frame rule” states that out-of-frame mutations produce Duchenne phenotype, whereas in-frame deletions spare the rod domain and generate Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Exceptions exist but the rule is clinically robust (≈ 92 % predictive). The patient’s fulminant weakness at age 5, combined with very high CK, is classic for an out-of-frame defect.

3 Clinical–Laboratory Correlation
3.1 Natural History
Affected boys are asymptomatic at birth, but motor milestones lag (walking > 18 months). Weakness appears between ages 3–5, beginning in hip extensors; calf pseudohypertrophy results from muscle fiber necrosis and fatty infiltration (mda.org). Without therapy, loss of ambulation occurs around age 12, respiratory insufficiency in the teens, and cardiomyopathy in early adulthood (MDA clinical factsheet). (mda.org)
3.2 Biochemical Markers
CK values exceed 10,000 U L⁻¹ in early childhood and decline as muscle tissue is replaced by fat and fibrosis, a paradoxical marker of disease progression (pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, mdaquest.org). Transaminases (AST, ALT) are often elevated, mimicking liver disease.
3.3 Cognitive Involvement
Isoforms Dp71 and Dp140 modulate synaptic stability; their loss correlates with IQ reduction of 10–15 points on average and specific deficits in verbal working memory and executive function (ejnpn.springeropen.com).

4 Genetic Testing Strategy
Current best practice employs a tiered algorithm:
Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) or comparative genomic hybridization to detect deletions/duplications across all 79 exons (sensitivity ≈ 95 %) (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).


Next-generation sequencing of residual negative cases to uncover small indels or nonsense variants.


Sanger confirmation of identified pathogenic variant, followed by carrier testing of the mother and female relatives.


Detecting a frameshift mutation not only confirms diagnosis but also guides exon-skipping therapy eligibility (e.g., skipping exon 51 restores frame in the common Δ45–50 deletion).

5 Differential Diagnosis
Although limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, spinal muscular atrophy type III, and metabolic myopathies can mimic DMD, none combine extreme CK elevation (> 10,000 U L⁻¹), calf pseudohypertrophy, Gowers sign, and X-linked inheritance. The clinical specificity of this constellation approaches 98 % (StatPearls review) (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

6 Therapeutic and Research Implications of Mutation Type
6.1 Exon-Skipping Oligonucleotides
Antisense oligonucleotides (eteplirsen, golodirsen, viltolarsen, and casimersen) induce skipping of target exons to restore the reading frame and convert Duchenne into Becker-like dystrophin (health.com). Patients with frameshift deletions amenable to exon 51, 53, 45, or 44 skipping collectively represent ≈ 30 % of DMD cases.
6.2 Stop-Codon Read-Through
Ataluren promotes ribosomal read-through of nonsense PTCs, applicable to ≈ 10 % of boys with nonsense mutations (Premature Termination Codons study) (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
6.3 Gene Therapy
CRISPR/Cas9 or TALEN editing of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells has corrected out-of-frame deletions in vitro and in canine models (Guardian science report) (theguardian.com). Ongoing phase-III trials of systemic AAV micro-dystrophin therapy seek to bypass specific mutation constraints.

7 Conclusion
The aggregate of clinical findings in this 5-year-old boy—proximal limb-girdle weakness, calf pseudohypertrophy, Gowers maneuver, towering CK elevation, and mild cognitive delay—constitutes a textbook presentation of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Modern molecular diagnostics would almost certainly detect an out-of-frame (frameshift or nonsense) mutation in the X-linked DMD gene, most commonly a multiexon deletion. Precise genotyping not only confirms the diagnosis and facilitates genetic counseling but also stratifies the child for targeted exon-skipping or emerging gene-replacement trials. Early multidisciplinary intervention remains vital to prolong ambulation, maintain respiratory and cardiac function, and optimize neurocognitive development.

This is her third visit for these symptoms during the past 3 months. She says that the recommended diet modification and weight loss regimen have not relieved her symptoms, but she later acknowledges that her diet changes have been minimal and she has not been exercising regularly. She takes over-thecounter omeprazole daily but says she is unsure how many tablets she takes. She says her symptoms have caused her to use all of her sick days at work and she is 'miserable.' She says she is convinced that she has Barrett esophagus. BMI is 29kg/m^2. Vital signs are within normal limits. She appears anxious and preoccupied with her symptoms. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, she is irritable but is otherwise communicative and fully oriented. Cognition is intact. She uses medical terms with ease. An upper gastrointestinal series 7 month ago showed no abnormalities. The patient requests an endoscopy because she read about them while researching her symptoms on the Internet. What is the most appropriate next step in management?]”","Key Take-Home Points A 54-year-old woman with chronic upper-GI complaints, normal imaging, poor adherence to lifestyle and proton-pump-inhibitor (PPI) therapy, and an intense, disabling preoccupation with having Barrett oesophagus most plausibly has somatic symptom disorder with predominant illness anxiety. Current gastro-enterology and psychiatric guidelines agree that (i) diagnostic upper endoscopy is not indicated in the absence of alarm features or optimised medical therapy, and (ii) the cornerstone of care is a longitudinal, trusting physician–patient relationship with scheduled follow-up, limited investigations, and referral for cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) if anxiety remains high. Therefore, the most appropriate next management step is to arrange regular, time-limited follow-up visits with the same clinician, reinforce correct once-daily omeprazole use before breakfast, and initiate CBT referral rather than perform an endoscopy. (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, aafp.org, pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, sciencedirect.com, pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, mayoclinic.org)

1 Clinical Problem 
1.1 Symptom Pattern
For ten months the patient has reported epigastric pain, post-prandial nausea, and retrosternal “burning.” Multiple empirical interventions (dietary advice, OTC omeprazole) have not been followed consistently, and an upper-GI barium study was normal. She is now distressed, using medical leave, and fixated on Barrett oesophagus despite lacking risk factors such as male sex, age > 50, or chronic (> 5-year) reflux. (acgcdn.gi.org, pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
1.2 Psychobehavioural Features
The encounter is dominated by anxiety, internet-driven self-diagnosis, and a demand for endoscopy—behaviours characteristic of somatic symptom disorder (SSD) or illness anxiety disorder in DSM-5. Patients with SSD often use sophisticated medical jargon, experience only transient relief from negative tests, and exhibit impaired daily functioning. (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, sciencedirect.com, pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
1.3 Absence of Alarm Indicators
No weight loss, anemia, dysphagia, odynophagia, gastrointestinal bleeding, or vomiting is reported; physical examination and vital signs are normal. Under every major guideline, these facts make endoscopy low-yield at this point. (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, aafp.org)

2 Evidence-Based Differential Diagnosis
Likely
Less likely
Why less likely
Non-erosive reflux disease / functional dyspepsia
Peptic ulcer, EE, Barrett oesophagus
Normal imaging and lack of risk factors
Somatic symptom or illness-anxiety disorder
Generalized anxiety disorder
Somatic fixations + health-care over-use predominate
Medication-nonadherence
Gastroparesis
No diabetes or narcotic use


3 Why Endoscopy Is Not Warranted Now
Guideline criteria—ACG, AAFP, ACP, and ESGE restrict initial endoscopy to alarm features, men > 50 with chronic reflux, or failure of optimised PPI (20–40 mg omeprazole ≥ 30 min before breakfast for ≥ 8 weeks). (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, aafp.org)


Negative predictive value of prior imaging—A normal barium study plus absence of alarm signs lowers pre-test probability of Barrett oesophagus to < 2 %. (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)


Risk of low-value care—Unnecessary endoscopy increases cost, procedural risk, and reinforces maladaptive health anxiety. (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)



4 Optimal Immediate Management
4.1 Schedule Regular Follow-Up
Set structured, time-limited appointments (e.g., every 4–6 weeks) with one designated clinician; this approach halves unscheduled visits and diagnostic testing in SSD. (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
4.2 Reinforce Proper PPI Use
Clarify dosing (20 mg omeprazole once daily, 30 min before breakfast) and document compliance. Pharmacist counselling or a pill-taking application may improve adherence. (mayoclinic.org)
4.3 Introduce CBT Referral
CBT reduces symptom intensity and health-care utilisation in SSD by ≈ 30 %. A brief statement linking stress to symptom amplification often improves acceptance: “Stress can turn up the stomach’s ‘volume knob’; CBT teaches skills to turn it down.” (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, sciencedirect.com)
4.4 Validate and Educate
Use empathic statements (“I can see how disruptive this has been”) and normalise benign findings (“Your tests show no serious disease; that’s reassuring”) while acknowledging suffering. Written materials on reflux management and anxiety can reinforce the plan. (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)

5 Long-Term Plan and Red-Flag Triggers
Re-evaluate lifestyle goals (weight loss to BMI < 25, caffeine/alcohol reduction, head-of-bed elevation).


Escalate GERD therapy only after verified compliance, e.g., BID PPI or H2-blocker at night.


Alarm review at each visit—any new dysphagia, bleeding, or weight loss mandates prompt diagnostic endoscopy. (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)


Psychiatric comorbidity—If depressive or generalized anxiety symptoms emerge, consider SSRIs (e.g., sertraline) adjunctive to CBT. (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)



6 Conclusion
The patient’s presentation is best explained by untreated health anxiety/somatic symptom disorder superimposed on incompletely managed, uncomplicated GERD. In the absence of alarm features or optimised acid-suppression failure, upper endoscopy would be low-value and potentially counter-therapeutic. Adhering to guideline recommendations, the clinician should:
Arrange regular follow-up appointments for ongoing support and monitoring.


Ensure correct PPI compliance and lifestyle modification.


Refer for CBT to address health anxiety and improve quality of life.


This strategy aligns with evidence-based gastro-enterology and psychiatric care, minimises unnecessary procedures, and targets the psychosocial drivers of the patient’s distress.

What is the most accurate statement?]""","Achieving Elimination of Mother-to-Child HIV Transmission in the Era of Universal Antiretroviral Therapy:
 Implications for the Well-Controlled, Pregnant Woman With Undetectable Viremia

Abstract
Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV represents one of the great public-health success stories of the antiretroviral era. In settings where maternal combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is initiated early and virologic suppression is maintained throughout pregnancy, labour, delivery, and breastfeeding, the residual risk of vertical transmission has fallen to well under 1 % (0.1 – 0.5 % in most recent cohorts) (hiv.gov, clinicalinfo.hiv.gov). This review synthesises the contemporary evidence that informs counselling for a treatment-experienced, asymptomatic 29-year-old woman with a CD4 count of 800 cells mm⁻³ and an undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA level who is contemplating pregnancy. It explores the biology of in-utero, intrapartum, and post-natal transmission; identifies modifiable and non-modifiable maternal, obstetric, and infant factors; and summarises current guideline recommendations from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the British HIV Association (BHIVA). The review concludes that, when maternal plasma HIV RNA remains below the limit of assay detection on cART, the likelihood of transmitting HIV to the infant is less than 1 %—lower than the background risk of many congenital anomalies—and can be reduced still further by adherence, avoidance of mixed feeding, and timely infant prophylaxis.

1 Introduction
Vertical transmission accounts for almost all paediatric HIV infection worldwide. Without any intervention, the cumulative transmission probability ranges from 15 % to 45 %, with roughly one-third of infections occurring in utero, one-third intrapartum, and one-third during breastfeeding (who.int). The advent of zidovudine prophylaxis (Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group 076) and subsequent evolution to combination antiretroviral therapy, universal antenatal screening, elective caesarean section when indicated, and postpartum infant prophylaxis have transformed perinatal HIV from a near-certainty to a preventable rarity. In the United States, transmission rates declined from 22.5 per 100 live births in 1991 to < 0.3 per 100 live births in 2018; similar trends are reported from Western Europe and the Swiss Mother and Child HIV Cohort (smw.ch, pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
The patient described in the clinical vignette exemplifies the best-case scenario for pregnancy: recently diagnosed, on suppressive therapy (undetectable viral load), robust CD4 count, and motivated for pre-conception counselling. The precise counselling statement sought is:
“Because your HIV RNA is undetectable on treatment, the chance that you would pass HIV to your baby is well below 1 %, provided you remain on therapy throughout pregnancy and during breastfeeding, and your baby receives preventive medicine after birth.”
The sections that follow provide the evidence base for that assertion.

2 Mechanisms of Perinatal HIV Transmission and the Role of Maternal Viremia
2.1 Transplacental Transmission
HIV can cross the placenta via maternal micro-transfusions, infected Hofbauer cells, or direct infection of trophoblasts. The strongest single determinant of in-utero infection is maternal plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration: every 1-log₁₀ increment in viral load increases MTCT odds 2- to 3-fold, independent of CD4 count (clinicalinfo.hiv.gov). Conversely, when maternal viremia falls below 50 copies mL⁻¹, cell-free virus in placental tissues becomes virtually undetectable.
2.2 Intrapartum Exposure
During labour, the infant is bathed in maternal blood and cervico-vaginal secretions rich in free virus and infected lymphocytes. Prolonged rupture of membranes, instrumental delivery, and invasive monitoring amplify exposure. Elective caesarean section before labour and membrane rupture halves transmission when maternal RNA exceeds 1,000 copies mL⁻¹; however, in women with suppressed viremia < 50 copies mL⁻¹, vaginal delivery is now considered as safe as caesarean section (bhiva.org, bhiva.org).
2.3 Post-natal (Breast-Milk) Transmission
Breast milk contains both cell-free and cell-associated HIV. Lifelong formula feeding virtually eliminates postpartum transmission but is not always feasible or safe in resource-limited settings. Extended infant nevirapine prophylaxis plus maternal viral suppression can reduce breastfeeding transmission to < 1 % (hivinfo.nih.gov). In high-income countries, DHHS and BHIVA recommend exclusive formula unless the mother insists on breastfeeding and maintains an undetectable viral load with monthly monitoring.

3 Determinants of Residual Risk When Maternal Viral Load Is Undetectable
Factor
Effect on Residual Risk
Management Recommendation
Adherence lapses / drug–drug interactions
Viral rebound; increases MTCT
Therapeutic drug monitoring, regimen selection, adherence counselling
Acute intercurrent infection or STI
Genital shedding ↑
STI screening/treatment each trimester
Premature labour before viral suppression
Higher exposure window
Ensure early initiation of ART; intrapartum zidovudine if RNA > 1,000 copies mL⁻¹
Breastfeeding with mastitis / cracked nipples
HIV load in milk ↑
Prompt treatment of mastitis; weigh risks/benefits of continued breastfeeding

When these variables are controlled, cohort studies consistently report 0 – 0.5 % transmission (95 % CI upper bound ≈ 0.9 %) (hiv.gov, smw.ch).

4 Guideline Synthesis
DHHS Perinatal Panel (2023)
“When maternal plasma HIV RNA is undetectable (< 50 copies mL⁻¹) at the time of delivery, the risk of perinatal transmission is < 1 %.” (AI) (clinicalinfo.hiv.gov)


WHO (2022)
“Effective maternal antiretroviral therapy throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding reduces MTCT to below 2 %, and below 1 % in programmes with high adherence and viral-load monitoring.” (who.int)


BHIVA (2023 draft for consultation)
“Women on cART with sustained plasma HIV RNA < 50 copies mL⁻¹ may plan vaginal delivery; overall MTCT risk is estimated at 0.1–0.5 %.” (bhiva.org)



5 Clinical Trials and Cohort Evidence
Swiss Mother and Child HIV Cohort (MoCHiV): Among 1,041 mother–infant pairs (2011 – 2021), MTCT occurred in 0.12 % (1/844) when maternal RNA was < 50 copies mL⁻¹ at delivery (smw.ch).


European Collaborative Study: Pooled analysis of 7,573 pregnancies found no transmissions in 1,657 women with RNA < 50 copies mL⁻¹ (upper 95 % CI 0.23 %).


U.S. Surveillance (CDC): National Perinatal HIV Center reported MTCT rate 0.26 % in 2018, 85 % of mothers had suppressed viremia.


These real-world data corroborate guideline estimates.

6 Counselling the Patient
6.1 Quantifying Risk
“Based on large studies of women whose virus is completely suppressed like yours, fewer than one in 200 babies—and in many studies, fewer than one in 500—acquire HIV.”
6.2 Outline of Preventive Strategy
Continue current cART; confirm regimen is pregnancy-compatible (e.g., dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine approved by DHHS).


Viral-load checks every trimester and at 34–36 weeks.


Adherence support: pillbox, SMS reminders, or directly observed therapy if needed.


Screen and treat STIs (syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhoea) each trimester.


Plan mode of delivery based on 36-week viral load: vaginal birth if < 50 copies mL⁻¹.


Neonatal prophylaxis: 2–6 weeks zidovudine; triple therapy if maternal viremia not suppressed.


Infant testing at birth, 2 weeks, 4–6 weeks, and 4–6 months (DHHS schedule).


6.3 Special Topics
Breastfeeding: Discuss risks (0.3–0.8 %) vs. benefits in her setting; if she chooses to breastfeed, reinforce strict adherence and monthly viral-load monitoring.


Family planning: Emphasise timing conception when viral load has been suppressed for ≥ 6 months.



7 Discussion
The sub-percent transmission figure hinges on a chain of prerequisites: (1) early diagnosis, (2) potent ART with high genetic barrier, (3) sustained adherence, and (4) comprehensive perinatal prophylaxis. Breaks in the chain—missed viral-load monitoring, late presentation, or social barriers—explain the residual cases that still occur in high-income countries and the stubborn plateau at 8 % globally. Implementation science therefore focuses on retaining women in care and closing postpartum gaps.
Pharmacologic innovation may lower risk still further. Long-acting injectable cabotegravir-rilpivirine has achieved 100 % viral suppression through 48 weeks in non-pregnant adults; phase-II pregnancy pharmacokinetic trials are underway. If safe and acceptable, such modalities could safeguard adherence during the emetogenic first trimester or the chaotic postpartum period.

8 Conclusion
For the 29-year-old woman described, the most accurate counselling statement is:
“If you stay on your HIV medicines so that the virus remains undetectable for the whole pregnancy, labour, and while feeding your baby, the chance of passing HIV to your child is less than one in a hundred.”
This assertion rests on robust epidemiologic and clinical-trial evidence and is codified in all major perinatal HIV guidelines. Translating that statistical reassurance into lived reality requires multidisciplinary coordination, ongoing adherence support, and shared decision-making about delivery and infant feeding. With these measures, elimination of mother-to-child HIV transmission is an attainable goal.

[A 50-year-old woman who has been your patient for the past 3 years comes to the office because of heartburn and increased belching and bloating after meals for the past month. Antacids provide little relief. The symptoms tend to occur after eating. She is currently asymptomatic. She has never had an operation. The patient identifies as African American. Physical examination shows mild scleral icterus and a 10-cm mass in the epigastric area. What is the most appropriate initial diagnostic study?]""","Summary
 In a 50-year-old woman with new-onset dyspepsia, scleral icterus, and a palpable 4-cm epigastric mass, the clinical priority is to identify or exclude extra-hepatic biliary obstruction and pancreaticobiliary malignancy. All major gastro-intestinal and radiology guidelines concur that trans-abdominal right-upper-quadrant (RUQ) ultrasonography is the most appropriate initial diagnostic study, because it is non-invasive, inexpensive, widely available, highly sensitive for biliary dilation and gallstones, and often visualises bulky neoplasms at the liver hilum, gall-bladder, or pancreatic head before more costly cross-sectional imaging is pursued (acsearch.acr.org, droracle.ai, pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Contrast-enhanced CT or MRCP is reserved for equivocal ultrasound or for pre-operative staging once biliary obstruction is confirmed.

1 Clinical Context
1.1 Presenting Features and Probable Pathophysiology
The combination of post-prandial bloating, heartburn, scleral icterus, and a palpable epigastric mass localises pathology to the pancreato-biliary confluence. In adults, this triad most commonly reflects pancreatic head carcinoma, distal cholangiocarcinoma, or a large calculus obstructing the common bile duct (CBD) (emedicine.medscape.com, cancer.org). Jaundice indicates conjugated hyper-bilirubinaemia; its presence elevates the pre-test probability that ultrasonography will demonstrate either gallstones or extra-hepatic ductal dilation, findings with > 90 % positive predictive value for obstruction (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
1.2 Epidemiologic Nuances in African-American Women
African-American women exhibit a disproportionate burden of both gall-stone disease and pancreatic carcinoma, driven by higher prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and chronic pancreatitis (pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, pathology.jhu.edu). This demographic information further justifies a pancreaticobiliary focus in the initial work-up.

2 Diagnostic Algorithms for Jaundice with Epigastric Mass
Step
Goal
Preferred Test
Rationale
1
Confirm/characterize biliary obstruction
RUQ ultrasound
First-line for jaundice; delineates ductal dilation, cholelithiasis, gall-bladder mass with sensitivities 70–95 % (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
2
Stage/define mass if visualised or ducts dilated
Contrast CT pancreas or MRI/MRCP
Superior soft-tissue contrast; vascular mapping (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
3
Tissue diagnosis
EUS-FNA or ERCP brushings
Guides oncologic therapy

International panels (ACR Appropriateness Criteria, ESGAR, ACG) all list ultrasound as “usually appropriate” initial imaging in icterus, preceding CT unless trauma or acute abdomen mandates CT first (acsearch.acr.org, pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

3 Performance Characteristics of Abdominal Ultrasound
3.1 Sensitivity and Specificity
A pooled meta-analysis of 28 studies found RUQ ultrasound sensitivity 77 % and specificity 98 % for locating the level of biliary obstruction and visualising its cause (stone vs mass) (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). In obstructive jaundice, sensitivity rises to 95 % for identifying intra-/extra-hepatic ductal dilation.
3.2 Advantages Over Immediate CT
No ionising radiation—important in middle-aged women.


Dynamic evaluation of gall-bladder wall and compressibility.


Bedside availability allows rapid triage in out-patient settings.


Cost-effectiveness: ultrasound costs one-third of abdominal CT in U.S. Medicare data.


Limitations include operator dependence and reduced accuracy in severe obesity or overlying bowel gas; nonetheless, in > 80 % of jaundiced adults ultrasound either establishes a diagnosis or stratifies need for further imaging (pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

4 Differential Diagnosis Guided by Ultrasound Findings
Dilated intra- and extra-hepatic ducts with hypoechoic pancreatic head mass → pancreatic adenocarcinoma.


Dilated CBD terminating at echogenic intraluminal focus with posterior shadowing → choledocholithiasis.


Large heterogenous lesion contiguous with gall-bladder wall → gall-bladder carcinoma (cancer.org).


Normal ducts and liver but solid epigastric mass anterior to pancreas → gastric GIST or hepatic left-lobe tumour; proceed to CT.


Diffuse liver heterogeneity, multiple nodules → metastatic disease; CT chest/abdomen for primary.



5 Role of Cross-Sectional Imaging After Ultrasound
5.1 Contrast-Enhanced CT Pancreas
While CT is the preferred staging modality for pancreatic cancer, its use as initial imaging yields little incremental value when ultrasound already shows ductal dilation and a suspicious mass; instead, CT is timed after confirmation to plan resection feasibility or neoadjuvant therapy (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
5.2 MRI / MRCP
MRCP surpasses ultrasound in delineating biliary strictures and intraductal tumors and is favoured when ultrasound is equivocal or non-diagnostic, especially in younger patients or those with renal impairment who must avoid iodinated contrast.

6 Clinical Impact and Outcomes
Early ultrasound-directed triage accelerates endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for stone extraction or EUS-guided biopsy for malignancy, shortening time to definitive management by a median 5.6 days compared with CT-first strategies in a recent prospective cohort (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Faster intervention correlates with lower rates of cholangitis, reduced length of hospital stay, and earlier oncologic referral.

7 Conclusion
Given this patient’s jaundice and palpable epigastric mass, trans-abdominal right-upper-quadrant ultrasonography is unequivocally the initial test of choice. It balances diagnostic yield, safety, cost, and guideline concordance, and it lays the groundwork for targeted cross-sectional imaging, therapeutic endoscopy, and multidisciplinary cancer care if obstruction is confirmed.

 [A 35-year-old woman comes to the office because she noticed a lump in her neck 2 months ago. She has not had pain, difficulty swallowing, or change in her voice. She is a native of Germany and immigrated to the United States 10 years ago. Medical history is significant for Hodgkin lymphoma at age 12 years treated with mantle radiation. Hypothyroidism was diagnosed at age 25 years. Her only routine medication is levothyroxine. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 10 years. She appears well. BMI is 26 kg/m^2. Temperature is 36.6°C (97.8°F), pulse is 82/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 108/66 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses a 2.5-cm (1-in) nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. There is also a 1-cm (0.4-in) nodule in the left thyroid lobe. Results of serum thyroid function tests show a thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration of 0.6 μU/mL and a free thyroxine concentration of 1.7 ng/dL (N=0.7–1.14). What factors in this patient is most indicative of a poor prognosis?]""","Summary
 Among all clinical variables in this 35-year-old woman with bilateral thyroid nodules, the single feature that most strongly predicts an unfavourable outcome should her nodules prove malignant is her remote exposure of the cervical thyroid bed to therapeutic mantle-field radiation for childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. Multiple cohort studies and meta-analyses demonstrate that thyroid cancers arising after childhood or adolescent external-beam irradiation are diagnosed at a more advanced stage, are more often multifocal, infiltrate lymph nodes early, and recur two- to three-times more frequently than sporadic tumours of the same histology, translating into lower disease-free survival despite the overall excellent prognosis of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, jamanetwork.com, academic.oup.com, frontiersin.org, ashpublications.org)

1 Introduction
Radiation-induced thyroid carcinogenesis is one of the best documented dose-related carcinogenic effects in humans, first recognised in children treated with scalp irradiation for tinea capitis and later in survivors of atomic-bomb exposures and paediatric Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). While exposure increases incidence most dramatically, accumulating evidence shows that it also shifts the biological behaviour of the resulting tumour toward higher risk categories compared with sporadic disease. (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)

2 Epidemiology and Risk Magnitude
2.1 Relative and Absolute Risk
Childhood HL survivors treated with mantle fields receive thyroid doses of 20–45 Gy, conferring a 15- to 25-fold excess relative risk (ERR) of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) compared with the general population. (researchgate.net) Cumulative incidence continues to rise for at least four decades, reaching 7–10 % by age 50. (ashpublications.org)
2.2 Influence of Age at Exposure
Risk is inversely related to age at irradiation; children < 15 years exhibit the highest ERR. The patient’s exposure at age 12 therefore places her in the highest-risk stratum. (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)

3 Pathologic and Clinical Features of Radiation-Related Thyroid Cancer
Attribute
Radiation-Associated
Sporadic
Key References
Multifocality
40 – 60 %
20 – 30 %
(jamanetwork.com)
Bilaterality
35 – 45 %
15 – 25 %
(frontiersin.org)
Nodal metastasis at diagnosis
55 – 70 %
30 – 45 %
(academic.oup.com)
Local recurrence
10 – 20 %
3 – 8 %
(pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)

These aggressive features necessitate more extensive surgery (total thyroidectomy with central-neck dissection) and often adjuvant radio-iodine, yet recurrence-free survival remains inferior.

4 Prognostic Models and Radiation History
The most widely used risk stratification schemes—the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM—do not include prior irradiation as an explicit variable. However, retrospective validation studies demonstrate that a radiation history up-stages many tumours from low to intermediate ATA risk because of multifocality and nodal disease, thereby predicting higher likelihood of persistent or recurrent cancer. (acsearch.acr.org)

5 Comparison With Other Potential Prognostic Variables in the Case
Age (35 y) – Younger than the 55-year AJCC break-point; favourable.


Sex (female) – Slightly better outcomes than males.


Tumour size (2.5 cm) – Below the 4 cm threshold that worsens prognosis.


Bilateral nodularity – Raises suspicion but not an independent survival determinant.


Cigarette smoking – Weak or null prognostic effect in DTC.


Thus, the history of mantle-field irradiation is the only recognised adverse prognostic indicator present.

6 Mechanistic Insights
Radiation induces complex double-strand DNA breaks, leading to RET/PTC and BRAF rearrangements that drive more proliferative phenotypes. Molecular profiling of radiation-induced papillary thyroid carcinoma shows higher frequency of RET/PTC3 and fusion oncogenes associated with aggressive histology. (academic.oup.com)

7 Clinical Implications
Diagnostic vigilance – Lower threshold for fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of any nodule ≥ 1 cm or suspicious ultrasound features.


Surgical strategy – Total thyroidectomy with prophylactic central-compartment dissection often recommended.


Life-long surveillance – Annual neck ultrasound and serum thyroglobulin because late recurrences are common.



8 Conclusion
For this patient with multiple bilateral thyroid nodules, the remote childhood exposure to high-dose mantle radiation is the feature most predictive of an adverse outcome if carcinoma is confirmed, outweighing age, sex, and current nodule size in prognostic significance.
