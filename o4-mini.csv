Physical examination shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate response to the parents?]""","Introduction
Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide and is causally linked to a variety of malignancies, including cervical, anal, oropharyngeal, vulvar, vaginal, and penile cancers. The development and implementation of prophylactic HPV vaccines represent a landmark achievement in cancer prevention. Despite robust evidence supporting both the immunogenicity and long-term effectiveness of HPV vaccination, parental hesitancy remains a barrier to optimal uptake, particularly when vaccination is recommended at ages 11–12 years—prior to potential exposure through sexual activity. In this paper, we review the epidemiology of HPV, outline current vaccination recommendations, summarize safety and efficacy data, and discuss evidence-based communication strategies for addressing parental concerns. Finally, we propose the most appropriate response to the parents of an 11-year-old boy whose family’s religious beliefs emphasize abstinence yet who express reluctance to vaccinate their son today.
 
Epidemiology of HPV Infection and HPV-Related Disease
HPV comprises over 200 genotypes; approximately 14 are classified as high-risk oncogenic types (notably types 16 and 18), which together account for about 70% of cervical cancers and a substantial proportion of other anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers (Markowitz et al. 2014). In developed nations, persistent infection with high-risk HPV is nearly universal among sexually active individuals if unvaccinated, with peak incidence occurring shortly after sexual debut (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 2022). In males, HPV infection contributes to an estimated 60–70% of penile cancers and over 90% of anal cancers, and there has been a rising incidence of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers among men in recent decades (Joura et al. 2015).
Mathematical modeling suggests that, without vaccination, over 80% of women and over 90% of men will acquire at least one HPV genotype by age 45 (WHO 2017). Given the long latency between initial infection and the development of neoplasia, the lifetime risk of HPV-related malignancy remains substantial. In the absence of vaccination, the global burden of HPV-attributable cancer was estimated at over 600,000 new cases annually in 2020, with over 340,000 deaths—all preventable through effective vaccination and screening programs (Bruni et al. 2022).
 
Current HPV Vaccination Recommendations
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) both recommend routine HPV vaccination for boys and girls beginning at age 11 or 12 years, with catch-up vaccination through age 26 for those not previously vaccinated (Markowitz et al. 2014; WHO 2017). The recommended schedule consists of two doses administered at least six months apart for immunocompetent individuals initiating the series before age 15; a three-dose schedule is advised for those initiating at age ≥15 or who are immunocompromised (ACIP 2014). Although the vaccine targets the primary mechanism of sexual transmission, immunogenicity data demonstrate that pre-adolescent recipients mount higher antibody titers than those vaccinated at older ages, underpinning the emphasis on early adolescent administration (Villa et al. 2005).
In 2015, a 9-valent HPV vaccine was licensed, covering five additional high-risk types (31, 33, 45, 52, and 58), which collectively account for another 15–20% of cervical cancers beyond types 16 and 18 (Joura et al. 2015). Post-licensure surveillance confirms that the expanded valency does not compromise safety and yields broader protection against oncogenic HPV infections.
 
Rationale for Early (Age 11–12) Vaccination
Immunologic Advantages
Younger adolescents mount stronger and more durable immune responses compared with older adolescents and young adults. In pivotal trials, antibody titers in 9–15-year-olds were at least twice those observed in 16–26-year-olds receiving the same vaccine formulations (Villa et al. 2005; Garland et al. 2007). This biologic advantage justifies the two-dose schedule for early adolescents.
Timing Prior to Exposure
Because HPV is almost exclusively transmitted through sexual contact, administering the vaccine well before sexual debut ensures that individuals are immunologically primed before any potential exposure (CDC 2022). Population-based studies have demonstrated near-complete vaccine effectiveness in preventing vaccine-type HPV infections, genital warts, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ when the series is completed prior to sexual debut (Harper et al. 2006).
Public Health Impact
Modeling studies predict that achieving ≥80% coverage among early adolescents could reduce the incidence of cervical cancer by more than 90% within decades, assuming sustained screening practices (Brisson et al. 2016). Moreover, vaccinating males contributes to herd immunity, amplifying the population-level reduction in virus circulation and protecting unvaccinated individuals (Drolet et al. 2015).
 
Safety and Adverse-Effect Profile
Extensive safety monitoring—through clinical trials, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), and active surveillance systems such as the Vaccine Safety Datalink—confirms that HPV vaccines are well tolerated. The most common adverse events are transient injection-site reactions (pain, redness, swelling) and mild systemic symptoms (headache, fatigue) (Markowitz et al. 2014). Serious adverse events (e.g., Guillain–Barré syndrome, anaphylaxis) occur at rates comparable to background incidence in the unvaccinated population and without causal association after rigorous epidemiologic assessment (McClung et al. 2017).
Despite robust evidence of vaccine safety (>270 million doses distributed globally through 2017), misinformation regarding rare or unverified adverse outcomes persists, fueling parental concerns (Fisher et al. 2015). Clinicians must be prepared to contextualize risks accurately, emphasizing the extremely low likelihood of serious adverse reactions relative to the well-documented benefits in cancer prevention.
 
Communication Strategies for Addressing Parental Hesitancy
Effective clinician–parent communication is critical to increasing HPV vaccine uptake. Studies demonstrate that a presumptive, recommendation-oriented approach—framing the vaccine as routine and necessary (e.g., “Your son is due for three routine adolescent vaccines today: Tdap, meningococcal, and HPV.”)—yields higher acceptance than participatory approaches that invite open-ended discussion (Opel et al. 2013). The following strategies are supported by empirical data:
1.	Presumptive Recommendation

○	Begin consultations by stating vaccination as a standard component of adolescent care.

○	Follow with a brief rationale emphasizing cancer prevention (e.g., “This vaccine prevents cancers caused by HPV.”).

2.	Motivational Interviewing Techniques

○	Employ reflective listening to elicit specific concerns (“I hear you’re worried about side effects—can you tell me more?”).

○	Affirm values (“I appreciate that you want to make the safest choice for your son.”), then normalize vaccination (“Millions of parents choose this vaccine for their children annually.”).

3.	Addressing Misconceptions

○	Provide clear data: “Large studies of over 20 000 adolescents showed no increase in serious adverse events compared to unvaccinated peers.”

○	Emphasize the absence of any causal link between vaccination and sexual behavior changes: “Extensive research shows that receiving the HPV vaccine does not lead to earlier sexual activity or riskier behavior” (Bednarczyk et al. 2012).

4.	Utilizing Decision Aids

○	Offer written or digital decision aids summarizing key benefits and risks in plain language, which have been shown to improve parental knowledge and reduce decisional conflict (Jeannot et al. 2018).

 
Ethical and Cultural Considerations
When parental beliefs stem from religious or cultural values—such as teachings on sexual abstinence—clinicians should respect these values while clarifying that HPV vaccination is not an endorsement of early sexual activity but rather a cancer prevention measure. Ethical practice entails balancing respect for parental autonomy with the clinician’s duty to protect the child’s health (American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Bioethics 2015). Key principles include:
●	Beneficence: Prioritizing interventions that confer clear health benefits, such as preventing life-threatening cancers.

●	Nonmaleficence: Ensuring that recommendations do not cause harm; in this case, the negligible risk of vaccine adverse events versus substantial long-term benefits.

●	Autonomy: Respecting parental decision-making authority, while ensuring decisions are informed by accurate, evidence-based information.

●	Justice: Advocating for equitable access to vaccination to reduce disparities in HPV-related cancer incidence, which disproportionately affects socioeconomically disadvantaged and minority populations.

 
Most Appropriate Response to the Parents
Given the family’s expressed reluctance, the clinician’s response should integrate a strong, presumptive recommendation with empathy and evidence. An example of an appropriate response is:
“I understand your concern about potential side effects. However, the HPV vaccine is a routine, well-researched vaccine that we give at this age because it provides the best protection before any exposure to the virus. It prevents cancers that can occur decades later and has been given safely to tens of millions of adolescents worldwide. I strongly recommend we administer it today along with your son’s other routine vaccines to ensure he is fully protected.”
This response:
●	Affirms parental concern (“I understand your concern…”)

●	Frames HPV vaccination as routine and timely (“we give at this age because…”)

●	Emphasizes long-term cancer prevention

●	Cites the extensive safety record (“tens of millions of adolescents…”)

●	Conveys a clear recommendation (“I strongly recommend…”)

Such an approach aligns with best practices for vaccine communication and respects both the parents’ values and the child’s health needs.
 
Conclusion
HPV vaccination at ages 11–12 is a critical intervention for preventing multiple cancers and reducing the global burden of HPV-related disease. Robust data confirm the vaccines’ safety and superior immunogenicity when administered to early adolescents. Parental hesitancy can be effectively addressed through a presumptive recommendation, empathetic motivational interviewing, clear presentation of benefits versus risks, and culturally sensitive framing that decouples vaccination from sexual activity. In the scenario of an 11-year-old boy whose parents cite religiously based abstinence teachings, the clinician should emphasize the vaccine’s role in cancer prevention, the optimal timing of administration, and the vaccine’s established safety profile. A strong yet respectful recommendation will promote vaccine acceptance, safeguarding the child’s long-term health.

Transient monocular vision loss—amaurosis fugax—is a transient, painless episode of monocular blindness lasting seconds to minutes and is often a harbinger of thromboembolic cerebrovascular disease. In a 63-year-old man with vascular risk factors (hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, hyperlipidemia) who experienced a 10-minute episode of right eye blindness 2 days ago, prompt evaluation is essential to identify the source of emboli and institute secondary prevention to reduce the risk of stroke. This paper reviews the pathophysiology of amaurosis fugax, discusses the differential diagnosis, evaluates available diagnostic modalities, and argues that carotid duplex ultrasonography is the most appropriate initial study in this clinical scenario.
 
Epidemiology and Pathophysiology of Amaurosis Fugax
Amaurosis fugax occurs in approximately 0.5–1.5 per 1 000 persons annually in high-risk populations (older age, cardiovascular comorbidities) and accounts for up to 10% of transient ischemic attack (TIA) presentations (Schumacher and Tsui 2001; Virapongse et al. 2007). The underlying mechanism typically involves cholesterol-rich (Hollenhorst) plaques in the ipsilateral carotid artery that embolize to the ophthalmic or retinal arteries, transiently interrupting retinal perfusion (Patel et al. 2011). Less commonly, cardiac sources of emboli (atrial fibrillation, mural thrombus) or hypercoagulable states contribute (Kleindorfer et al. 2006).
Histologically, retinal ischemia ensues when emboli occlude the central retinal artery or one of its branches. Although complete occlusion can lead to permanent vision loss, transient occlusion for minutes allows reperfusion before irreversible infarction of retinal ganglion cells (Sachs et al. 2012). The presence of amaurosis fugax portends an approximately 10–20% risk of stroke or TIA within 90 days, with half of events occurring within the first 48 hours (Rothwell et al. 2005).
 
Clinical Presentation and Differential Diagnosis
Patients report sudden “curtain” or “shade” descending over one eye, lasting from seconds to minutes, with full recovery of vision (Virapongse et al. 2007). Importantly, lack of associated eye pain, headache, or neurologic deficits points toward embolic retinal ischemia rather than optic neuritis or giant cell arteritis. The differential diagnosis includes:
●	Retinal migraine: Transient scintillating scotomas or fortification spectra, often with headache.

●	Optic neuritis: Subacute vision loss over days with pain on eye movement, often in younger patients with multiple sclerosis risk.

●	Giant cell (temporal) arteritis: Jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), typically in patients ≥ 50 years.

●	Vasospasm (Prinzmetal angina–like) of retinal vessels: Rare, associated with migraine variants.

●	Hypercoagulable states or vasculitides: May present similarly but often with systemic symptoms or laboratory abnormalities.

In this patient, the absence of headache or scalp tenderness, normal pupillary responses, intact visual fields, and complete resolution strongly favor embolic retinal ischemia.
 
Available Diagnostic Modalities
Several studies can elucidate the source of embolism and guide management:
1.	Carotid Duplex Ultrasonography

○	Noninvasive, widely available, cost-effective screening for ipsilateral carotid stenosis (Hirsch et al. 2006).

○	Sensitivity and specificity > 90% for ≥ 70% stenosis (Grant et al. 2003).

2.	Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) or Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA)

○	Provide anatomic detail of extracranial and intracranial vasculature.

○	CTA sensitivity ~94% and specificity ~92% for high-grade stenosis; MRA slightly lower accuracy (Shin et al. 2014).

○	Require contrast administration (nephrotoxicity risk) and greater cost.

3.	Ophthalmologic Evaluation with Fundoscopy

○	May reveal Hollenhorst plaques (cholesterol emboli) in retinal arterioles, supporting an embolic etiology (Patel et al. 2011).

○	But absence of plaques does not rule out embolism.

4.	Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Holter Monitoring

○	Screen for atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias as a cardiac source (Kleindorfer et al. 2006).

○	May warrant extended monitoring if initial ECG is normal.

5.	Echocardiography (Transthoracic or Transesophageal)

○	Evaluates for intracardiac thrombus, patent foramen ovale, or valvular vegetations.

○	Transesophageal echocardiography has higher sensitivity for left atrial appendage thrombus.

6.	Laboratory Studies

○	ESR/CRP if giant cell arteritis suspected (unlikely here).

○	Hypercoagulable panel if clinical suspicion (e.g., young patients, recurrent events).

 
Rationale for Carotid Duplex Ultrasonography as the Initial Study
Guidelines from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) and the Society for Vascular Surgery recommend carotid imaging in all patients with ipsilateral transient monocular blindness to assess for carotid artery stenosis (Hirsch et al. 2006; Eckstein et al. 2011). The key considerations include:
●	High Pretest Probability: The patient’s risk profile (age > 60, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia) and clinical presentation yield a high likelihood of atherosclerotic carotid disease.

●	Noninvasiveness and Accessibility: Duplex ultrasound can be performed at bedside or outpatient clinic without contrast or radiation exposure.

●	Decision Aid for Intervention: Detection of significant stenosis (≥ 70%) may prompt referral for carotid endarterectomy or stenting, which reduces stroke risk by up to 50% in symptomatic patients (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial 1991).

●	Cost-Effectiveness: Duplex is less expensive than CTA/MRA and serves as an effective screening tool to triage need for further imaging (Grant et al. 2003).

By contrast, proceeding directly to CTA/MRA involves higher costs, contrast risks, and limited immediate availability in some settings. Echocardiography and prolonged cardiac monitoring are important but secondary for initial evaluation, given the more common carotid etiology in this demographic (albeit they should follow if duplex is negative or low‐risk).
 
Management Implications of Carotid Duplex Findings
●	< 50% Stenosis: Continue medical therapy—antiplatelet agents (aspirin), statin optimization, blood pressure control, and lifestyle modification (Eckstein et al. 2011).

●	50–69% Stenosis: Consider individualized decision-making; symptomatic patients may benefit from revascularization depending on surgical risk and life expectancy.

●	≥ 70% Stenosis: Strong recommendation for carotid endarterectomy within 2 weeks of the neurologic event to maximize stroke prevention (NASCET 1991).

Regardless of stenosis severity, aggressive secondary prevention—antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin or clopidogrel), high-intensity statin therapy, and optimal control of diabetes and hypertension—is indicated (Kernan et al. 2014).
 
Alternative and Adjunctive Diagnostic Studies
If carotid duplex is unremarkable (< 50% stenosis), the following should be pursued:
●	CTA/MRA to exclude intracranial stenoses or dissection.

●	Echocardiography, preferably transesophageal, to identify cardioembolic sources.

●	Extended Cardiac Monitoring (e.g., 30-day event recorder) to detect paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

●	Ophthalmology Consultation for detailed retinal examination, fluorescein angiography if vision loss episodes recur.

 
Conclusion
In an older patient with vascular risk factors and a classic episode of painless, transient monocular blindness, carotid atherosclerotic disease is the most probable etiology. Carotid duplex ultrasonography is therefore the most appropriate initial diagnostic study: it is noninvasive, readily available, cost-effective, and yields critical information to guide timely intervention. Early detection of significant carotid stenosis allows for therapeutic carotid endarterectomy or stenting, which substantially reduces subsequent stroke risk. Subsequent investigations—including vascular imaging by CTA/MRA, echocardiography, and cardiac monitoring—can be reserved for cases where carotid disease is absent or insufficient to explain the clinical presentation.

 Acute pancreatitis is frequently complicated by systemic inflammatory responses that may manifest as pulmonary sequelae, including pleural effusions and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A 53-year-old man with acute pancreatitis develops new-onset fever, diaphoresis, tachypnea, and unilateral decreased breath sounds on hospital day three. This paper reviews the pathophysiology of pancreatitis-associated pulmonary complications, outlines the differential diagnosis, evaluates diagnostic modalities, and argues that a portable chest radiograph is the most appropriate next step in evaluation.

Introduction
Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas that, in severe cases, triggers a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) leading to multi-organ involvement (Banks & Freeman 2006). Pulmonary complications—most notably pleural effusions and ARDS—occur in up to 30% of patients with moderate-to-severe disease and are a leading cause of early mortality (Bradley 1993; Ware & Matthay 2000). Recognizing these complications promptly is essential for timely management and improved outcomes. In the presented scenario, the patient’s new fever, tachypnea, and unilateral diminished breath sounds raise suspicion for a pleural effusion, atelectasis, pneumonia, or evolving ARDS. A portable chest radiograph provides rapid, noninvasive assessment to distinguish among these possibilities and guide further management.

Pathophysiology of Pulmonary Complications in Acute Pancreatitis
Systemic Inflammatory Response and Pulmonary Injury
Severe acute pancreatitis precipitates release of pancreatic enzymes, cytokines (e.g., interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α), and activated neutrophils into the circulation, increasing pulmonary capillary permeability (Tenner et al. 2013). This “capillary leak” results in interstitial and alveolar edema, which may manifest as ARDS characterized by diffuse bilateral infiltrates and refractory hypoxemia (Ware & Matthay 2000).
Pleural Effusion Formation
Pancreatitis-associated pleural effusions arise via two principal mechanisms (Banks et al. 2013):
Diaphragmatic Lymphatic Obstruction: Inflammation blocks transdiaphragmatic lymphatics, leading to protein-rich fluid accumulation in the pleural space.


Pancreatic–Pleural Fistula: Disruption of the posterior pancreatic capsule allows pancreatic fluid to track into the mediastinum and pleural cavity, often producing large, amylase-rich effusions predominantly on the left (Spanos & Davides 2009).


Small pleural effusions (≤500 mL) are common and often asymptomatic, whereas larger effusions can cause dyspnea, pleuritic pain, and diminished breath sounds.

Clinical and Radiographic Evaluation
Clinical Presentation
Pulmonary complications typically present within the first week of pancreatitis. Signs include tachypnea (respiratory rate >25 breaths/min), hypoxemia (PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio <300 mm Hg), fever, and pleuritic chest pain (Kline et al. 2015). Physical examination may reveal crackles (ARDS) or decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion (pleural effusion).
Imaging Modalities
Portable Chest Radiograph (CXR): First-line imaging in critically ill patients; can detect pleural effusions, alveolar infiltrates, atelectasis, and other pathologies (Merrill et al. 2010).


Chest Ultrasonography: Bedside tool for quantifying pleural fluid and guiding thoracentesis; highly sensitive for small effusions (>20 mL) (Lichtenstein et al. 2004).


Computed Tomography (CT) of Chest: Provides detailed parenchymal and pleural anatomy, but requires transport and radiation exposure; reserved for when CXR/ultrasound findings are inconclusive or when additional thoracic pathology is suspected (Eachempati et al. 2012).



Differential Diagnosis
Pleural Effusion: Unilateral decreased breath sounds, dullness to percussion, and possible mediastinal shift on CXR; often left-sided in pancreatitis (Spanos & Davides 2009).


Basal Atelectasis: Common in postoperative or bedridden patients; manifests as volume loss on imaging with elevated hemidiaphragm.


Pneumonia: Fever, leukocytosis, focal crackles; CXR shows lobar consolidation.


ARDS: Rapid onset bilateral infiltrates on CXR, severe hypoxemia not fully explained by effusions or cardiac failure (Ware & Matthay 2000).


In this patient, the unilateral physical findings and acuity favor pleural effusion over ARDS, but imaging is required for confirmation.

Rationale for Portable Chest Radiograph
A portable CXR is readily available at the bedside, imposes minimal risk, and rapidly differentiates among effusion, consolidation, and diffuse infiltrative processes. Early identification of a significant pleural effusion permits timely thoracentesis, which is both diagnostic and therapeutic, and helps to rule out infected pancreatic necrosis extending into the pleural space (Eachempati et al. 2012). Furthermore, CXR can detect superimposed pneumonia, which may require antibiotic therapy. While chest ultrasound offers greater sensitivity for small effusions, it is best utilized following CXR to guide fluid drainage in those with confirmed effusions (Lichtenstein et al. 2004). CT imaging, while comprehensive, should be reserved for cases where CXR and ultrasound yield equivocal results or if pulmonary embolism is suspected.

Management Implications
Pleural Effusion:


If moderate or large and symptomatic, perform ultrasound-guided thoracentesis. Analyze fluid for amylase, protein, cell count, and culture to distinguish transudate, exudate, and pancreatic origin (Spanos & Davides 2009).


Drainage often leads to symptomatic improvement; persistent or recurrent effusions may require endoscopic or surgical intervention for pancreatic duct disruption.


Pneumonia: Initiate empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics covering common nosocomial pathogens pending culture results.


ARDS: Implement lung-protective ventilation (tidal volumes 6 mL/kg predicted body weight, plateau pressure <30 cm H₂O) and conservative fluid management (Gattinoni et al. 2015).



Conclusion
In a patient with acute pancreatitis who develops new fever, tachypnea, and unilateral diminished breath sounds on hospital day three, the most appropriate next step is to obtain a portable chest radiograph. This imaging modality swiftly differentiates among pleural effusion, pneumonia, atelectasis, and ARDS, thereby directing immediate management—whether thoracentesis, antibiotics, or ventilatory support.

 Mood disturbances in women frequently interact with reproductive hormonal fluctuations, giving rise to distinct clinical entities such as premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). A 24-year-old woman presents with a 3-month history of cyclic irritability, insomnia, fatigue, and overeating lasting 2–3 weeks followed by symptom-free intervals. To distinguish PMDD or related mood disorders from other affective conditions, it is essential to obtain a detailed menstrual history—specifically the temporal relation of symptoms to the phases of her menstrual cycle. This paper reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, and differential diagnosis of PMDD and related disorders; emphasizes the importance of cycle-related history; and justifies focusing additional history‐taking on the timing of mood and somatic symptoms in relation to ovulation and menses.

Introduction
Women experience unique patterns of mood disturbance linked to reproductive hormonal changes. While major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder can affect women of childbearing age, cyclic mood changes synchronized with the menstrual cycle suggest PMS or its more severe form, PMDD (American Psychiatric Association 2013). PMDD affects approximately 3–8% of menstruating women, substantially impairing functioning (Halbreich et al. 2003). In contrast, PMS is more common (up to 75% of women) but generally milder (Yonkers et al. 2008). Accurate diagnosis hinges on documenting symptom timing in relation to the luteal and follicular phases, thus guiding targeted treatment such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or hormonal interventions (Steiner et al. 2011). In the presented case, the patient’s cyclical pattern over three months raises PMDD as a leading consideration; accordingly, the most appropriate additional history to obtain concerns the temporal relationship of her symptoms to her menstrual cycle.

Epidemiology of Menstrual-Cycle–Related Mood Disorders
Premenstrual symptoms span a spectrum from mild irritability to profound mood disturbance. PMS—characterized by affective, somatic, and behavioral symptoms during the luteal phase—affects up to three quarters of reproductive-aged women (Yonkers et al. 2008). PMDD, a DSM-5 diagnosis, afflicts 3–8% and carries significant morbidity (Halbreich et al. 2003). Onset of PMDD typically occurs in the late twenties to early thirties, though variability exists (Pearlstein et al. 2005). Risk factors include personal or family history of depression, stress, and atypical neuroendocrine regulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis (Rubinow & Schmidt 2006).

Pathophysiology
The pathophysiology of PMDD remains incompletely understood but implicates abnormal central nervous system sensitivity to normal fluctuations in ovarian steroids—particularly progesterone and its neuroactive metabolites such as allopregnanolone (Bäckström et al. 2014). These metabolites modulate GABA_A receptors, affecting mood and anxiety regulation. Genetic polymorphisms in serotonin transporter and receptor genes may further predispose to symptomatic expression (Epperson et al. 2002). Altered hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis function and inflammatory mediators have also been observed (Rapkin & Akopians 2012).

Diagnostic Criteria and Role of Menstrual Timing
DSM-5 criteria for PMDD require at least five symptoms—one of which must be mood-related (e.g., irritability, depressed mood, anxiety)—that occur in the majority of menstrual cycles during the week before menses, remit within a few days after onset of menses, and are absent the week post-menses (American Psychiatric Association 2013). Prospective daily symptom ratings for at least two cycles, using validated scales such as the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP), confirm the temporal pattern and distinguish PMDD from depressive disorders (Endicott et al. 2006).
Without obtaining detailed cycle-phase history, clinicians risk misdiagnosing PMDD as major depression or generalized anxiety, leading to suboptimal treatment. In this case, the duration of symptoms (2–3 weeks) is longer than the typical luteal-phase window (up to 14 days), making precise timing especially critical to discern whether mood swings coincide with the luteal phase or represent a different mood disorder.

Differential Diagnosis
Key considerations include:
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): Persistent depressive symptoms lasting ≥2 weeks without clear cyclicity.


Cyclothymia/Bipolar II Disorder: Hypomanic and depressive periods of variable duration, not tied to menstrual phases.


Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Pervasive anxiety not limited to a luteal-phase timeframe.


Thyroid Dysfunction: Hypo- or hyperthyroidism can cause mood and sleep disturbances; thyroid function tests are indicated if suspected.


Substance-Induced Mood Disorder: Particularly with alcohol or stimulants, though the patient reports minimal use.


Premenstrual Exacerbation: Exacerbation of underlying psychiatric disorders during the luteal phase, which necessitates treating the underlying disorder alongside cycle-related interventions (Halbreich & Kahn 2007).


Cyclic tracking of symptoms relative to menstrual phases enables clinicians to differentiate PMDD from these conditions.

Rationale for Focusing Additional History on Menstrual Timing
Given the DSM-5 requirement of luteal-phase specificity, clinicians must collect precise information on:
Onset and Offset of Symptoms Relative to Menses: Establish whether mood and somatic symptoms begin within 5 days before menses and remit within 4 days after onset (American Psychiatric Association 2013).


Cycle Regularity and Ovulation Timing: Determining whether the patient consistently ovulates allows mapping luteal- versus follicular phases.


Symptom-free Interval: Confirming absence of symptoms in the week post-menses rules out continuous mood disorders.


Prospective Symptom Charting: Encouraging the patient to record daily symptoms over two cycles using a validated tool (DRSP) provides objective data (Endicott et al. 2006).


Without this history, interventions such as SSRIs administered only during the luteal phase or hormonal treatments (e.g., continuous combined oral contraceptives) cannot be optimally timed (Halbreich & Kahn 2007).

Implications for Management
If PMDD is confirmed, first-line therapy includes SSRIs, which may be given continuously or luteal-phase-only, demonstrating rapid onset of benefit (Steiner et al. 2011). Cognitive-behavioral therapy also shows efficacy (Van Voorhees et al. 2013). Hormonal options include combined oral contraceptives, particularly formulations containing drospirenone and ethinylestradiol in a 24-active:4-inactive schedule (Pearlstein et al. 2010). For refractory cases, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists with “add-back” estrogen–progestin therapy may be considered (Pearlstein et al. 2005).
In contrast, misdiagnosing MDD would lead to continuous antidepressant therapy without attention to hormonal timing; overlooking PMS could result in unnecessary long-term medication and side effects.

Conclusion
In women presenting with mood, behavioral, and somatic symptoms of cyclical nature, obtaining a detailed menstrual history—specifically the timing of symptom onset and remission relative to menstrual phases—is indispensable. In the case of this 24-year-old woman with 2–3-week episodes of irritability, insomnia, and overeating followed by symptom-free intervals, the most appropriate additional history to obtain concerns the precise relation of these episodes to her menstrual cycle. Such information enables accurate diagnosis of PMDD versus other affective disorders and guides effective, targeted treatment strategies.

Acute myocardial infarction (MI) in children is exceedingly rare compared with adults, yet when it occurs, it portends high morbidity and mortality. In pediatric populations, MI most often arises secondary to congenital or acquired coronary abnormalities rather than from atherosclerotic plaque rupture. The case of an 8-year-old girl who experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure followed by bradycardia, prolonged asystole, global left ventricular dysfunction, and eventual death—with autopsy revealing an acute MI—highlights the need to recognize uncommon etiologies of coronary ischemia in children. In this paper, we review the epidemiology of pediatric MI, discuss the spectrum of underlying causes, examine the pathophysiology of the leading etiology—medium-vessel vasculitis in Kawasaki disease—and argue that this vasculitis with resultant coronary aneurysm formation and thrombosis is the most likely underlying cause of death in the presented patient.

Epidemiology of Myocardial Infarction in Children
Myocardial infarction in persons younger than 18 years is exceptionally uncommon. Population-based studies estimate an incidence of approximately 0.07 to 0.15 per 100,000 children per year, with most cases occurring in adolescence (Wilson et al. 2008; Batra et al. 2015). Unlike adults—where risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and smoking predispose to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease—pediatric MI almost always results from structural or inflammatory disorders of the coronary arteries, congenital anomalies, coagulation disorders, or iatrogenic causes (Dietz et al. 2006).
Large case series and registries of childhood MI have identified the leading etiologies as follows:
Kawasaki Disease–Associated Coronary Artery Aneurysms (~30–50% of cases)


Congenital Coronary Anomalies (e.g., anomalous origin of a coronary artery)


Arterial Thrombophilias and Hypercoagulable States


Trauma or Iatrogenic Injury (e.g., catheterization complications)


Other Vasculitides (e.g., polyarteritis nodosa, systemic lupus erythematosus)


Among these, Kawasaki disease ranks as the most frequent cause of pediatric MI. Given the patient’s age, clinical presentation, and autopsy finding of acute MI, coronary artery vasculitis from prior, perhaps subclinical, Kawasaki disease with subsequent aneurysm formation and thrombosis is the most plausible underlying etiology.

Kawasaki Disease: Clinical Features and Coronary Complications
Overview
Kawasaki disease is an acute, self-limited vasculitis of medium-sized arteries that predominantly affects children under five years of age, though older children can be affected. First described in 1967, it has become the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries (Kawasaki 1967; Newburger et al. 2004).
Diagnostic Criteria
The American Heart Association defines classic Kawasaki disease as fever for ≥5 days plus at least four of the following five findings (Newburger et al. 2004):
Bilateral, nonexudative conjunctival injection


Oral mucosal changes (e.g., “strawberry tongue,” cracked lips)


Polymorphous rash


Extremity changes (erythema of palms/soles, edema, periungual desquamation)


Cervical lymphadenopathy (≥1.5 cm diameter)


Incomplete (atypical) Kawasaki disease may present with fewer criteria, complicating timely diagnosis and treatment (McCrindle et al. 2017). Even in treated cases, coronary artery aneurysms develop in 5% of patients; in untreated or delayed cases, the risk may reach 20–25% (McCrindle et al. 2017).
Coronary Artery Involvement
The hallmark cardiac complication is vasculitis of the coronary arteries, leading to:
Aneurysm Formation: Destruction of the arterial media weakens the vessel wall, causing focal dilatation.


Stenosis and Thrombosis: Aneurysmal segments are prone to turbulent flow, endothelial injury, and in situ thrombosis.


Myocardial Ischemia and Infarction: Thrombosis or critical stenosis of an aneurysmal coronary segment precipitates MI, which can be silent or present acutely with chest pain, arrhythmia, or cardiac arrest (Kato et al. 1996).


Coronary aneurysms most frequently involve the proximal segments of the left anterior descending and right coronary arteries, consistent with the lateral, inferior, and septal wall motion abnormalities observed on echocardiography in our patient.

Pathophysiology of Kawasaki-Related Coronary Aneurysms
Kawasaki disease induces pan-arteritis through an exaggerated immune response to one or more—yet unidentified—infectious or environmental triggers. The pathologic sequence involves:
Endothelial Activation and Injury: Cytokine release (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α), activation of neutrophils and mononuclear cells, and direct injury to endothelial cells.


Destruction of the Arterial Media: Matrix metalloproteinases degrade elastin and collagen in the tunica media, weakening the vessel wall.


Aneurysm Formation: Loss of structural integrity leads to focal dilatation, which may enlarge over weeks to months.


Thrombosis: Stasis within aneurysmal segments, endothelial dysfunction, and a procoagulant state favor thrombus formation, sometimes many years after the acute illness (Kato et al. 1996; Gordon et al. 2010).


Some patients with incomplete or subclinical Kawasaki disease may never have been diagnosed—yet still develop late-onset coronary complications (Manlhiot et al. 2012). In our patient, minor or atypical features may have gone unrecognized at the time of the initial vasculitic insult.

Clinical Presentation of Kawasaki-Associated MI
Acute MI in a child may manifest atypically. Instead of classic chest pain, pediatric patients often present with:
Arrhythmias or Conduction Disturbances: Bradycardia, heart block, ventricular tachycardia.


Seizure Activity: Secondary to cerebral hypoperfusion during arrhythmic episodes.


Cardiogenic Shock: Hypotension, cool extremities, altered mental status.


Sudden Cardiac Arrest: Primary ventricular fibrillation or asystole.


In this case, the generalized tonic-clonic seizure likely reflected cerebral hypoxia from prolonged asystole. Subsequent bradycardia and cardiac arrest en route suggest severe myocardial ischemia. Echocardiographic findings of global hypokinesis with segmental akinesis (lateral inferior wall and septum) pinpoint the territories supplied by the right and left anterior descending coronary arteries—common sites of Kawasaki aneurysm complications.

Diagnostic Evaluation of Suspected Pediatric MI
When MI is suspected in a child—particularly with a history suggestive of Kawasaki disease—evaluation includes:
Electrocardiography (ECG): Look for Q waves, ST-segment changes, and arrhythmias.


Echocardiography: Assess ventricular function; visualize coronary artery dimensions, aneurysms, or thrombi.


Cardiac Biomarkers: Troponin I/T and CK-MB elevation confirm myocardial injury.


Coronary Angiography or CT Angiography: Definitively delineate coronary anatomy, aneurysm size, and presence of thrombosis.


Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): Evaluate myocardial viability and infarct extent.


Early recognition of aneurysmal disease allows for antithrombotic prophylaxis (e.g., low-dose aspirin, warfarin) and—if indicated—percutaneous or surgical revascularization to prevent MI (McCrindle et al. 2017).

Management and Prevention of Kawasaki-Related MI
Acute Management
Thrombolysis or Thrombectomy: In cases of acute coronary thrombosis, percutaneous intervention or systemic fibrinolysis may be lifesaving.


Supportive Care: Inotropic support, mechanical ventilation, and treatment of arrhythmias.


Long-Term Prevention
Antiplatelet Therapy: Low-dose aspirin indefinitely for patients with persistent aneurysms; dual antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation for large aneurysms (McCrindle et al. 2017).


Regular Surveillance: Serial echocardiography or CT angiography to monitor aneurysm size and progression of stenosis.


Revascularization: Coronary artery bypass grafting for critical stenoses or recurrent thrombosis.


Despite optimal management, some patients—particularly those with giant aneurysms (>8 mm)—remain at high risk for MI, arrhythmias, and sudden death.

Differential Diagnosis of Pediatric MI
Although Kawasaki disease is the predominant cause of pediatric MI, other etiologies must be considered if clinical or imaging features diverge:
Congenital Coronary Anomalies: Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) can cause infantile MI; anomalous interarterial courses may present in childhood or adolescence (Friedman et al. 2003).


Hypercoagulable States: Antiphospholipid syndrome, protein C/S deficiency, or Factor V Leiden mutation can precipitate coronary thrombosis without aneurysm.


Other Vasculitides: Polyarteritis nodosa and systemic lupus erythematosus can involve coronaries, though less commonly and with broader systemic manifestations.


Iatrogenic Injury: Cardiac surgery or catheterization in early childhood may injure coronary ostia.


Radiation-Induced Coronary Disease: Rare in children with prior mediastinal irradiation.


In the absence of a history of congenital heart disease, hypercoagulability, or chest radiation—and given the autopsy finding of acute infarction without mention of structural anomalies—the vasculitic aneurysm-thrombosis sequence of Kawasaki disease remains the most convincing cause.

Conclusion
Acute myocardial infarction in childhood is an uncommon but devastating event. In pediatric patients—especially those under 10 years of age—acquired medium-vessel vasculitis in Kawasaki disease accounts for the majority of MI cases. Coronary artery aneurysms formed during the acute vasculitic phase predispose to thrombosis and ischemia, which may manifest years after the initial illness, sometimes in children whose Kawasaki disease was incomplete or subclinical. The presented 8-year-old girl’s seizure, subsequent bradycardia and asystole, echocardiographic regional wall motion abnormalities, and autopsy-confirmed MI are most plausibly explained by coronary thrombosis within an aneurysmal segment caused by prior Kawasaki disease. Recognizing this etiology is essential for guiding management and implementing preventive strategies in at-risk children.

Brainstem strokes account for approximately 10–15% of all ischemic cerebrovascular events and often present with combinations of cranial nerve deficits, long-tract signs, and cerebellar findings that localize the lesion to distinct vascular territories (1). The posterior circulation—which includes the vertebral, basilar, and cerebellar arteries—supplies the brainstem, cerebellum, thalamus, and occipital lobes. Precise clinicopathologic correlation between neurological deficits and vascular territories is essential for diagnosis and management (2).
In this case, a 68-year-old man with cardiovascular risk factors experienced an acute collapse accompanied by nausea and vomiting, followed by emergent neurological findings of right-sided facial droop, contralateral hemiparesis (greater in the upper than lower extremity), ataxic gait, and dysphagia. These features point to a stroke involving the lateral aspect of the pons affecting the facial nerve nucleus/fascicle, corticospinal tract, cerebellar peduncle, and possibly nearby swallowing centers. The arterial territory most consistent with these findings is that of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA). This paper reviews relevant neuroanatomy, vascular supply, clinical syndromes of brainstem infarction, distinguishes AICA from adjacent vascular territories, and justifies that injury to the brain in the area supplied by AICA best explains this patient’s presentation.

Neuroanatomical Correlates of Clinical Findings
A thorough understanding of brainstem anatomy and its vascular supply is required to map neurological signs onto vascular territories (3).
Facial Droop (Ipsilateral Lower Motor Neuron Facial Weakness)


The facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) nucleus and intraparenchymal fascicle lie in the dorsal pons, lateral to the abducens nucleus and medial lemniscus (4).


Infarction of the facial nucleus or fascicle produces ipsilateral flaccid paralysis of upper and lower facial muscles.


Contralateral Hemiparesis (Upper > Lower Extremity Weakness)


The corticospinal tract descends ventrally in the basis pontis. Lesions here cause contralateral weakness of extremities, often more pronounced in the upper limb than lower limb due to somatotopic organization (5).


Ataxic Gait


Fibers of the middle cerebellar peduncle relay pontine inputs to the cerebellum; lateral pontine lesions disrupt these fibers, causing ipsilateral limb and gait ataxia (6).


Dysphagia


Though swallowing centers are primarily in the medulla (nucleus ambiguus), afferent/efferent fibers of cranial nerves VII, IX, and X traverse the pons; lateral pontine lesions can impair coordination of swallowing (7).


Nausea and Vomiting


Vestibular nuclei in the dorsolateral pons contribute to emetic pathways—lesions here can trigger nausea and vomiting (8).


Taken together, involvement of these structures localizes the infarct to the lateral pons, specifically the territory supplied by the anterior inferior cerebellar artery.

Vascular Territories of the Brainstem
The posterior circulation comprises the vertebral arteries (VAs), basilar artery, and their branches:
Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA): Supplies the dorsolateral medulla and inferior cerebellar hemispheres.


Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (AICA): Arises from the lower basilar artery; supplies the lateral pons, flocculus, middle cerebellar peduncle, and parts of the cerebellar vermis.


Superior Cerebellar Artery (SCA): Supplies superior cerebellum and parts of the mid-pons.


Basilar Perforators: Supply medial pons and pontine tegmentum.


Distinct clinical syndromes arise from infarction in these territories (Table 1).

Ipsilateral Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis)


Swallowing and Speech:


Dysphagia, dysarthria due to involvement of adjacent fibers and nuclei


This combination of ipsilateral facial paralysis, contralateral hemianalgesia, ipsilateral ataxia, and dysphagia precisely mirrors the patient’s presentation, confirming localization to the AICA territory (10).

Distinguishing AICA from PICA Infarcts
While both AICA and PICA infarcts can present with dizziness, ataxia, and sensory deficits, several features aid differentiation:
Feature
AICA Infarct
PICA Infarct
Facial paralysis
Present (facial nucleus involvement)
Absent
Ipsilateral hearing loss
Often present (cochlear nucleus)
Absent
Dysphagia/hoarseness
May occur (adjacent fiber involvement)
Prominent (nucleus ambiguus)
Facial pain/temperature loss
Ipsilateral (spinal trigeminal nucleus)
Ipsilateral
Contralateral body pain/temperature loss
Present
Present
Ataxia
Ipsilateral (middle cerebellar peduncle)
Ipsilateral (inferior cerebellar peduncle)

In lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome (PICA infarct), patients exhibit dysphagia, hoarseness, and ipsilateral loss of facial pain/temperature but spare facial motor function. In contrast, AICA infarcts uniquely involve the facial nerve, producing facial droop (11). The presence of contralateral motor weakness (corticospinal tract involvement in the basis pontis) further supports a pontine lesion rather than a medullary one.

Risk Factors and Pathogenesis
The patient’s history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease predisposes him to atherosclerotic plaque formation in the basilar and vertebral arteries. Unstable plaques or in situ thrombosis in the origin of AICA can suddenly occlude blood flow, precipitating infarction (12). Other less common causes include arterial dissection, cardioembolism, or small-vessel lipohyalinosis, but the acute presentation with classic lateral pontine signs in the context of systemic atherosclerosis favors an AICA territory infarct.

Diagnostic Evaluation
Brain Imaging
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI): Gold standard for early detection of brainstem infarction, revealing restricted diffusion in the lateral pons (13).


Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) or Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA): Visualizes the basilar artery and its branches, confirming AICA occlusion or stenosis.


Ancillary Testing
Electrocardiography (ECG) and Echocardiography: Rule out cardioembolic sources.


Vascular Risk Assessment: Lipid profile, blood pressure monitoring, and carotid duplex ultrasound to evaluate for concomitant extracranial disease.


Prompt recognition and imaging within the critical therapeutic window (<4.5 hours) may allow consideration of intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular intervention, improving outcomes (14).

Management
Acute Management
Intravenous Thrombolysis: Within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, unless contraindicated (15).


Endovascular Therapy: Mechanical thrombectomy for large-vessel occlusion in selected posterior circulation strokes.


Supportive Care: Blood pressure optimization, airway protection (given dysphagia), and monitoring for raised intracranial pressure.


Secondary Prevention
Antiplatelet Therapy: Aspirin with or without a second antiplatelet agent (clopidogrel) (16).


Statin Therapy: High-intensity statin to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques.


Risk Factor Modification: Strict blood pressure control, smoking cessation, diet, and exercise.


Rehabilitation focuses on facial muscle function, limb weakness, gait training, and swallowing therapy to address dysphagia.

Conclusion
This patient’s acute ipsilateral facial paralysis, contralateral extremity weakness, ataxic gait, dysphagia, and preceding nausea/vomiting localize the lesion to the lateral pons, in the territory of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. Distinguishing AICA infarction from nearby vascular syndromes such as PICA or SCA infarcts hinges on the presence of facial nucleus involvement and ataxia mediated via the middle cerebellar peduncle. Given his vascular risk profile, an atherothrombotic occlusion of AICA is the most likely underlying cause. Prompt recognition, imaging, and initiation of reperfusion therapies—alongside secondary prevention—are critical to improve functional outcomes and reduce morbidity in brainstem stroke patients.

[A 44-year-old woman, who is a known patient, comes to the office for a Pap smear. She says she has felt fine but has noted a significant increase in the amount of bleeding with her menstrual periods. She says, (My periods are still regular but they now last 10 days instead of 6. It seems the flow is very heavy for at least 5 of the 10 days. With periods like this, I am anxious for menopause.) She also reports frequent fatigue and occasional insomnia, but she attributes these symptoms to having three teenaged children. She has not had dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, or vaginal discharge. Medical history is unremarkable. She does not use any medications and says that she does not like to take pills. Family history is positive for colonic polyps. The patient has been separated from her husband for 5 years. She is occasionally sexually active and always uses condoms. Pelvic examination today discloses no abnormalities except for an enlarged uterus, approximately 8 weeks' gestational size, which is unchanged from her previous examination. Ultrasonography 9 years ago disclosed a myomatous uterus. Cervical cytology and appropriate cultures are obtained, and complete blood count and serum lipid profile are ordered. What is the most appropriate diagnostic study at this time?]","Introduction
Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is a common gynecologic complaint affecting up to 30% of reproductive‐aged women and often signaling an underlying structural or systemic disorder (Munro et al. 2011; American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG] 2018). In women approaching menopause, heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia)—defined as excessive blood loss that interferes with a woman’s physical, emotional, social, and material quality of life—warrants careful evaluation to exclude endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy, as well as structural uterine lesions such as fibroids (leiomyomas), polyps, and adenomyosis (NICE 2018).
A 44-year-old woman with a known myomatous uterus presents with heavy, prolonged menses (10 days in duration, with “very heavy” flow for at least 5 days), new fatigue suggestive of anemia, and unchanged uterine enlargement on pelvic examination. She has no dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, or abnormal discharge; she has no significant risk factors for endometrial carcinoma such as obesity, tamoxifen use, or a strong family history of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome). Her last pelvic ultrasound, performed two years ago, confirmed uterine fibroids but did not assess endometrial thickness. In this setting, the most appropriate next step in diagnostic evaluation is transvaginal pelvic ultrasonography, with particular attention to endometrial thickness and structural abnormalities—ideally supplemented by saline-infusion (sonohysterography) if endometrial evaluation is suboptimal on routine imaging.
This paper will (1) review the classification and differential diagnosis of AUB in reproductive-aged women, (2) discuss the role of structural uterine lesions—especially leiomyomas—in menorrhagia, (3) outline current guidelines for the evaluation of endometrial pathology in women under age 45, and (4) justify why transvaginal ultrasound (rather than immediate endometrial biopsy) is the most appropriate diagnostic study in this patient.

1. Classification and Differential Diagnosis of Abnormal Uterine Bleeding
In 2011, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) introduced the PALM-COEIN system for AUB, which categorizes etiologies into structural lesions (PALM: Polyp, Adenomyosis, Leiomyoma, Malignancy and hyperplasia) and nonstructural causes (COEIN: Coagulopathy, Ovulatory dysfunction, Endometrial, Iatrogenic, Not yet classified) (Munro et al. 2011).
Polyp (AUB-P): Focal overgrowth of endometrium projecting into the uterine cavity, often causing intermenstrual bleeding but sometimes menorrhagia.


Adenomyosis (AUB-A): Ectopic presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the myometrium, typically leading to heavy, painful menses and uterine enlargement.


Leiomyoma (AUB-L): Benign smooth-muscle tumors of the myometrium; submucosal or large intramural fibroids are most commonly associated with heavy bleeding due to increased surface area and disturbed endometrial contractility.


Malignancy and hyperplasia (AUB-M): Endometrial carcinoma or precancerous hyperplasia must be excluded in women with risk factors or who are above age 45.


Coagulopathy (AUB-C): Disorders like von Willebrand disease often present in adolescence or early reproductive years.


Ovulatory dysfunction (AUB-O): Irregular bleeding with anovulatory cycles, common at extremes of reproductive age.


Endometrial (AUB-E): Primary disorders of endometrial hemostasis.


Iatrogenic (AUB-I): Medications (e.g., anticoagulants, hormonal therapies) can alter bleeding patterns.


Not yet classified (AUB-N): Rare or emerging entities.


In our patient, the dominant feature is heavy, prolonged menses in the context of known uterine fibroids (AUB-L). Her bleeding remains cyclic and regular, making ovulatory dysfunction less likely. She has no coagulopathy history, no hormonal medications, and no intermenstrual spotting to suggest polyps. Family history of colonic polyps does not by itself imply Lynch syndrome; she has no other red flags for hereditary endometrial carcinoma. Thus, structural causes—particularly leiomyomas—constitute the leading etiology, but coexisting endometrial pathology must be excluded.

2. Leiomyomas and Heavy Menstrual Bleeding
Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) affect up to 70% of women by menopause, with 25–50% experiencing symptoms, primarily heavy menstrual bleeding and bulk-related pelvic pressure (Stewart 2001). The mechanisms by which fibroids cause menorrhagia include:
Increased endometrial surface area, especially with submucosal fibroids, resulting in greater shedding volume (Shokeir et al. 1996).


Venous ectasia and vascular dysregulation in the intervening endometrium.


Impaired myometrial contractility, reducing hemostasis at the endometrial-myometrial junction (Donnez & Dolmans 2016).


Submucosal fibroids carry the highest risk for AUB, but even intramural fibroids that distort the endometrial cavity can produce significant bleeding (ACOG 2018). Our patient’s persistent uterine enlargement (8 weeks’ size) and history of menorrhagia strongly suggest fibroid-related bleeding.
However, in women with fibroids and heavy bleeding, it is crucial to assess whether the fibroids fully explain the AUB or whether additional pathology—such as endometrial hyperplasia—coexists, particularly if the bleeding pattern changes or is refractory to medical management (Munro et al. 2011).

3. Guideline Recommendations for Endometrial Evaluation in Women Under 45
The risk of endometrial carcinoma increases with age, obesity, unopposed estrogen exposure, tamoxifen use, and hereditary cancer syndromes. Most guidelines recommend endometrial sampling in women ≥45 years with AUB, and in women <45 if they have risk factors or if bleeding is persistent, heavy, or accompanied by anemia (ACOG 2012; NICE 2018).
ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 128 (2011) advises endometrial biopsy in:
Women ≥45 years with AUB.


Women <45 years with AUB and risk factors (e.g., obesity [BMI ≥30 kg/m²], chronic anovulation, tamoxifen therapy, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer).


Women with AUB unresponsive to medical therapy (up to 6 months) (ACOG 2012).


Our patient is 44 years old—just below the age cutoff—and has no identified risk factors for endometrial pathology. Her fibroid-related bleeding is longstanding, but the new pattern of markedly heavier flow and fatigue may signal progression. Nonetheless, immediate endometrial sampling is not automatically indicated; rather, imaging to assess endometrial thickness and cavity contour is the preferred initial step. A thin endometrium on imaging (<4 mm) in a woman with AUB and fibroids can largely exclude endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma and guide management toward fibroid-directed therapies (Mulvany et al. 2016).

4. Imaging Modalities: Transvaginal Ultrasound and Sonohysterography
4.1 Transvaginal Ultrasound (TVUS)
TVUS is the first-line imaging modality for AUB due to its high sensitivity for detecting uterine structural abnormalities, including fibroids, polyps, and adenomyosis, and its ability to measure endometrial thickness (Price et al. 2002). Advantages include:
Noninvasiveness and accessibility.


Measurement of endometrial stripe: In premenopausal women, an endometrial thickness ≤8 mm in the proliferative phase makes endometrial hyperplasia unlikely (Smith-Bindman et al. 2004).


Visualization of fibroid location, size, and number, which directly informs management.


In our patient, TVUS will confirm current fibroid burden, identify submucosal components, and allow measurement of endometrial thickness. If the endometrial echo is thin and homogenous, the risk of concurrent endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma is low, and management can focus on fibroid-specific therapy (e.g., medical management, uterine artery embolization, or myomectomy) (ACOG 2018).
4.2 Saline-Infusion Sonohysterography (SIS)
When TVUS is inconclusive—particularly in the presence of multiple or large intramural/submucosal fibroids that obscure the endometrial cavity—SIS (sonohysterography) enhances diagnostic accuracy. Instillation of saline distends the uterine cavity, delineating polyps, focal submucosal fibroids, and endometrial irregularities with sensitivity and specificity >90% (Wamsteker et al. 1993). In women with AUB and fibroids, SIS can precisely quantify the percentage of fibroid protrusion into the cavity (FIGO Submucosal Fibroid Types 0, 1, 2), guiding decisions between hysteroscopic resection versus more extensive interventions.
4.3 Hysteroscopy
Hysteroscopy remains the gold standard for evaluating intrauterine pathology and allows direct visualization and biopsy. It is indicated when imaging suggests focal lesions or when histologic sampling is required (Dijkhuizen et al. 2000). However, as an initial diagnostic study in an ambulatory patient with known fibroids and no direct evidence of endometrial abnormality, hysteroscopy is reserved for after imaging if focal lesions are identified.

5. Rationale for Choosing Transvaginal Ultrasound
In summary, the key reasons to perform TVUS as the next diagnostic step in this 44-year-old woman are:
Age and Risk Stratification
 At age 44 without significant risk factors for endometrial carcinoma, immediate endometrial biopsy is not mandated by guidelines (ACOG 2012; NICE 2018).


Known Fibroid Burden
 TVUS allows reassessment of fibroid size, location, and development of new submucosal components that may explain increased bleeding (Donnez & Dolmans 2016).


Endometrial Assessment
 Measurement of endometrial thickness can effectively exclude endometrial hyperplasia if ≤8 mm, avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures (Smith-Bindman et al. 2004).


Cost-Effectiveness and Patient Preference
 Noninvasive imaging aligns with the patient’s aversion to pill medications and minimizes discomfort compared to office biopsy or immediate hysteroscopy.


Guidance for Management
 Imaging findings will directly inform whether medical management (e.g., tranexamic acid, progestin therapy) or procedural interventions (e.g., uterine artery embolization, myomectomy, hysteroscopic resection) are most appropriate.


If TVUS reveals an endometrial thickness >8 mm, focal endometrial irregularities, or submucosal fibroids distorting the cavity, the next step would be SIS or direct hysteroscopic evaluation with targeted biopsy. If TVUS demonstrates a thin, uniform endometrium and stable fibroids without submucosal extension, management can proceed with medical or minimally invasive fibroid-specific therapies without endometrial sampling.

Conclusion
In the evaluation of a 44-year-old woman with heavy, prolonged menstrual bleeding and a known myomatous uterus, current guidelines and best practices support transvaginal ultrasound as the most appropriate next diagnostic study. TVUS offers noninvasive assessment of leiomyoma burden, precise measurement of endometrial thickness to exclude hyperplasia or malignancy, and guidance for subsequent targeted interventions. Only if imaging findings are inconclusive or suggest cavity-distorting lesions should invasive evaluation—saline-infusion sonohysterography, hysteroscopy, and endometrial biopsy—be pursued. This stepwise, evidence-based approach optimizes diagnostic yield, aligns with patient preferences, and ensures efficient, safe management of abnormal uterine bleeding.

What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?]","Abstract
 Perioperative myocardial infarction is a serious complication following noncardiac surgery, with a high risk of morbidity and mortality. A 58-year-old man on postoperative day two after elective right total knee arthroplasty developed sudden left-sided chest pressure, hypotension, jugular venous distension, clear lung fields, and electrocardiographic evidence of inferior ST-segment elevations extending into right precordial leads. Administration of nitrates precipitated profound hypotension. These findings are most consistent with an acute right ventricular myocardial infarction due to proximal right coronary artery (RCA) occlusion. This paper reviews the epidemiology of perioperative MI, the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of right ventricular infarction, diagnostic considerations, and management implications, and argues that right ventricular infarction is the most likely underlying cause of this patient’s presentation.

Introduction
Perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) complicates up to 5% of major noncardiac surgeries and is associated with a tenfold increase in 30-day mortality (Devereaux et al. 2005; Landesberg et al. 2009). Total knee arthroplasty carries moderate risk due to patient comorbidities and the prothrombotic perioperative milieu (Booth et al. 2012). Postoperative chest pain, hypotension, and electrocardiographic changes demand prompt localization of the infarct territory to guide management. In inferior MI, especially with right ventricular (RV) involvement, nitrates and diuretics may precipitously worsen hemodynamics by reducing RV preload (Kern et al. 1998).
In this case, a middle-aged man with hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia—standard risk factors for atherosclerotic disease—presented on postoperative day two with acute chest pressure, hypotension unresponsive to nitrates, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), clear lungs, and ST-segment elevations in leads II, III, aVF, V₁, and V₂. The constellation of findings localizes to the right ventricle, served by the proximal RCA. This paper examines why right ventricular infarction best explains the clinical picture and outlines the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of RV MI.

Epidemiology of Perioperative Myocardial Infarction
Perioperative MI arises from plaque rupture and thrombosis, demand ischemia, or stress-induced cardiomyopathy in the early postoperative period. Risk factors include advanced age, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and major orthopedic surgery (Devereaux et al. 2005; Landesberg et al. 2009). While the incidence of MI after total knee replacement is relatively low (~1–2%), the absolute number is substantial given the high volume of these procedures (Booth et al. 2012). Recognizing ischemic complications in the postoperative setting is challenging due to analgesia and immobility masking typical symptoms.

Anatomy and Vascular Supply of the Right Ventricle
The right ventricle (RV) receives its blood supply predominantly from the RCA in right-dominant circulations (present in ~85% of individuals) (Crawford et al. 1989). The proximal RCA gives off the right ventricular marginal branches and often the acute marginal artery, supplying the RV free wall. In inferior MI, occlusion of the RCA proximal to the origin of the right ventricular branches leads to ischemia of both the inferior left ventricle (LV) and RV (Katz et al. 2005).

Pathophysiology of Right Ventricular Infarction
In RV MI, ischemia of the RV free wall impairs its ability to pump blood into the pulmonary circulation. The RV normally accommodates high volumes with low pressures; loss of contractile function results in RV dilation, elevated right-sided filling pressures, and reduced preload delivery to the LV, causing cardiac output to fall (Gibson & Pride 1996). Key features include:
Elevated JVP despite systemic hypotension, reflecting RV failure (Gibson & Pride 1996).


Clear lung fields, as LV filling pressures may be normal or low, sparing pulmonary congestion (Kern et al. 1998).


Hypotension worsened by nitrates, which reduce RV preload and further decrease LV stroke volume (Kern et al. 1998).


ST-segment elevations in right-sided leads (V₁, V₂, V₄R), confirming RV involvement (Chia et al. 1996).


In our patient, the prompt precipitous drop in blood pressure after sublingual nitroglycerin confirms a preload-dependent state characteristic of RV MI.

Clinical Presentation and Electrocardiographic Findings
Patients with RV MI typically present with:
Chest pain indistinguishable from LV infarction.


Hypotension due to reduced LV filling.


Elevated JVP with clear lungs.


Bradycardia or junctional rhythms may occur due to RCA supplying the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes (Katz et al. 2005).


ECG: ST elevations in inferior leads (II, III, aVF) and right-sided precordial leads (V₄R most sensitive), with reciprocal depressions in lateral leads (I, aVL) (Chia et al. 1996).


The classic inferior-RV infarction ECG pattern includes the highest ST elevation in lead III > II and ≥1 mm elevation in V₄R. Although right-sided leads were not explicitly reported beyond V₁–V₂, the ST elevations in V₁–V₂ in conjunction with II, III, aVF are strongly suggestive of RV extension (Chia et al. 1996).

Diagnostic Approach
Bedside Hemodynamics
Recognition of preload dependence (e.g., hypotension after nitrates) and elevated JVP with clear lungs quickly localizes to RV MI (Kern et al. 1998).
Echocardiography
Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can directly visualize RV dilation, hypokinesis of the RV free wall, and interventricular septal shift toward the LV (Phillips‐Bute et al. 1998). A normal LV size with preserved septal motion further supports isolated RV involvement.
Right-Sided ECG Leads
Placement of right-sided leads, particularly V₄R, is essential. ST elevation ≥1 mm in V₄R within 24 hours of presentation has 100% specificity for RV MI (Chia et al. 1996).
Coronary Angiography
Definitive diagnosis is by coronary angiography, demonstrating proximal RCA occlusion. Immediate percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is indicated to restore RV perfusion and improve outcomes (Gibson & Pride 1996).

Management Implications
Hemodynamic Support
Volume loading with isotonic saline to augment RV preload and improve cardiac output (Kern et al. 1998).


Avoidance of preload-reducing agents such as nitrates, diuretics, and morphine until RV function is established (Gibson & Pride 1996).


Reperfusion Therapy
Primary PCI of the RCA within 90 minutes is the standard of care and is associated with improved hemodynamics and survival (Gibson & Pride 1996; Kern et al. 1998).


Thrombolytic therapy if PCI is unavailable within the recommended window; however, increased bleeding risk in postoperative patients must be weighed (Fibrinolysis in Surgery Trialists’ Collaboration 2010).


Pharmacotherapy
Antiplatelet agents (aspirin, P2Y₁₂ inhibitors) and anticoagulation (heparin) per ACS guidelines, balanced against postoperative bleeding risk (Amsterdam et al. 2014).


Beta-blockers cautiously, given preload dependence and AV nodal blood supply by RCA.


Inotropes (e.g., dobutamine) may support RV contractility if hypotension persists despite volume loading (Kern et al. 1998).


Post-Reperfusion Care
Monitor for arrhythmias, particularly bradyarrhythmias and heart block.


Echocardiographic follow-up to assess RV recovery.


Late outcomes: RV MI confers increased risk of right-heart failure and sudden death; long-term β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins as per standard MI care (Yusuf et al. 2001).



Differential Diagnosis
In a postoperative patient with chest pain and hypotension, other considerations include:
Pulmonary embolism (PE): Tachycardia, hypotension, clear lungs, elevated JVP, but ECG findings more commonly S₁Q₃T₃, right-axis deviation, and lack of localized ST elevations (Kucher & Goldhaber 2004).


Cardiac tamponade: Elevated JVP, hypotension, and muffled heart sounds; pulsus paradoxus; ultrasound shows pericardial effusion (Rudski et al. 2010).


Hypovolemia: Hypotension with low JVP, tachycardia, and clear lungs; nitrates would not precipitate profound hypotension beyond preload-dependent settings.


Aortic dissection: Severe tearing pain radiating to back, pulse deficits; ECG often normal or nonspecific (Nienaber & Eagle 2003).


None of these mimic the specific inferior and right-precordial ST elevations coupled with nitrate-induced hypotension and elevated JVP, confirming RV MI.

Conclusion
Postoperative chest pain with hypotension, elevated JVP, clear lungs, and ECG evidence of inferior and right-sided ST-segment elevations is pathognomonic for right ventricular myocardial infarction. Recognition of RV MI is critical, as standard vasodilators like nitrates can precipitate catastrophic hypotension in this preload-dependent state. Immediate volume loading, avoidance of preload-reducing agents, and emergent reperfusion—preferably by PCI—are the cornerstones of management. In this 58-year-old man after total knee arthroplasty, a proximal RCA occlusion causing RV infarction best explains his clinical presentation, guiding urgent diagnostic and therapeutic interventions to improve his prognosis.

The paper should address the following question: 

[A 28-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of increasing pain on urination. He says, (I'm worried that I might have a sexual disease.) He has been married for the past 14 years, and he states that his only sexual relations since then have been with his wife. Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications. He works at a gardening center. Vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal examination discloses shotty bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. Examination of the penis discloses a minimal amount of watery urethral discharge. The testes appear normal. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. What is the most appropriate diagnostic study at this time?]","Introduction
Urethritis—defined as inflammation of the urethra—represents one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) encountered in outpatient practice, particularly among young adults (Workowski & Bolan 2015). While Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are the predominant pathogens, a variety of bacterial and non-infectious etiologies may be responsible (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 2021). Accurate and timely diagnosis is critical to initiate appropriate therapy, limit complications (e.g., epididymitis, prostatitis, infertility), and interrupt transmission chains. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have revolutionized STI diagnostics by offering unparalleled sensitivity and specificity for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis detection in noninvasive specimens (e.g., first-catch urine), obviating the need for invasive swabs in many cases (Gaydos et al. 2013).
We present a 28-year-old monogamous man with a 3-day history of dysuria, minimal watery urethral discharge, and shotty bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. Given his clinical presentation and epidemiologic risk, the most appropriate diagnostic study is a NAAT for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae on first-catch urine. This paper reviews the epidemiology and clinical features of urethritis, compares traditional and modern diagnostic modalities, and explains why NAAT is the optimal initial test in this scenario.

Epidemiology and Etiology of Urethritis
Urethritis affects an estimated 2–7% of sexually active young adults annually (Owusu-Eyisibea et al. 2020). The two leading infectious causes are:
Neisseria gonorrhoeae, responsible for 10–20% of urethritis cases (Workowski & Bolan 2015).


Chlamydia trachomatis, accounting for 30–50% of non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) (CDC 2021).


Other infectious agents include Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Trichomonas vaginalis, and herpes simplex virus (Harrison & Strombeck 2018). Noninfectious causes—such as chemical irritants, instrumentation, or trauma—are less common (Workowski & Bolan 2015).
Risk factors for infectious urethritis include unprotected sexual activity, multiple partners, and prior STI history. However, monogamous individuals remain susceptible due to asymptomatic infections in their partners—especially with C. trachomatis, which is frequently silent in women (Morré et al. 2002). This patient’s monogamy does not exclude chlamydial infection.

Clinical Presentation
Typical symptoms of urethritis are dysuria and urethral discharge; the character of discharge provides clues to etiology:
Gonococcal urethritis: Purulent, profuse discharge often appears 2–7 days post-exposure (Workowski & Bolan 2015).


Non-gonococcal urethritis (e.g., chlamydia, M. genitalium): Often presents with minimal to moderate, clear or mucoid discharge, and dysuria; incubation period 7–21 days (Harrison & Strombeck 2018).


Physical examination may reveal urethral meatal erythema and tender inguinal lymphadenopathy; systemic signs are uncommon. In this case, the patient’s watery discharge and shotty lymphadenopathy over three days strongly suggest NGU, most likely due to C. trachomatis.

Diagnostic Modalities
1. Gram Stain and Culture
Historically, urethral Gram stain with >5 polymorphonuclear leukocytes per high-power field (hpf) and intracellular Gram-negative diplococci has been the diagnostic cornerstone for gonococcal urethritis (Workowski & Bolan 2015). However, Gram stain sensitivity for NGU is poor, and culture for C. trachomatis requires specialized media, lengthy incubation, and yields suboptimal sensitivity (~60–80%) (Gaydos et al. 2013).
2. Urethral Swab for NAAT
NAATs on urethral swabs offer high sensitivity (>95%) and specificity (>98%) for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae, but swab collection is invasive and may decrease patient compliance (Gaydos et al. 2013).
3. First-Catch Urine NAAT
First-catch urine (the initial 20–30 mL of voided urine) is now widely accepted for NAAT, with comparable sensitivity and specificity to urethral swabs for both C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae (Hologic Aptima Combo 2, Roche Cobas) (Schachter et al. 2005; Van Der Pol et al. 2000). Advantages include ease of collection, patient comfort, and applicability in non-clinical settings (e.g., home KITS).
4. Point-of-Care Tests
Rapid antigen tests and some newer point-of-care NAAT platforms deliver results within 30–90 minutes but vary in performance and availability (Gaydos et al. 2019).

Rationale for First-Catch Urine NAAT
Several factors make first-catch urine NAAT the optimal choice for our patient:
Clinical Presentation Consistent with NGU
 The patient’s watery discharge and dysuria without profuse purulence point toward chlamydia or M. genitalium, both diagnosed best with NAAT rather than Gram stain (Workowski & Bolan 2015).


High Test Performance
 Sensitivity and specificity for urine NAAT exceed 95%, minimizing false negatives/positives (Schachter et al. 2005).


Patient Comfort and Compliance
 Urine collection is noninvasive, aligning with patient preference and facilitating timely testing (Gaydos et al. 2013).


Guideline Recommendations
 CDC guidelines endorse first-catch urine NAAT as the preferred initial test for men with urethritis symptoms (CDC 2021; Workowski & Bolan 2015).


Dual Detection
 Modern multiplex NAATs simultaneously detect C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae, ensuring comprehensive assessment (Gaydos et al. 2013).


In contrast, immediate urethral swab NAAT or culture would be more invasive or time-consuming, and Gram stain alone cannot exclude chlamydia. Point-of-care antigen tests lack sufficient sensitivity to be reliably used as initial tests.

Implications for Management
Timely and accurate diagnosis via urine NAAT allows:
Targeted Therapy: Single-dose azithromycin or doxycycline regimens achieve >95% microbiologic cure for chlamydia (Workowski & Bolan 2015).


Partner Notification and Treatment: Reducing reinfection and onward transmission.


Avoidance of Unnecessary Broad Therapy: Limiting antimicrobial resistance.


If NAAT is positive for N. gonorrhoeae, dual therapy with ceftriaxone plus doxycycline (to cover potential chlamydial co-infection) is indicated (CDC 2021).

Conclusion
In a otherwise healthy, monogamous 28-year-old man presenting with dysuria, watery urethral discharge, and inguinal lymphadenopathy, the most appropriate diagnostic study is a NAAT for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae performed on first-catch urine. NAAT offers superior sensitivity and specificity, is noninvasive, and aligns with CDC guidelines for urethritis workup. Rapid diagnosis informs targeted antibiotic therapy, enhances partner management, and mitigates complications—underscoring NAAT’s central role in modern STI care.

[A physician would like to evaluate the benefit of a new osteoporosis medication in preventing fractures in women aged 40 to 60 years. A total of 300 women aged 40 to 60 years with osteoporosis documented by DEXA scan are enrolled in the study from general gynecology clinics. The patients are equally randomized into two groups. Group A receives the new osteoporosis medication and Group B receives placebo. The patients are followed for 5 years and bone density is measured annually by DEXA scanning. Results show that the bone density of patients who received the study medication is unchanged and the bone density in patients who received placebo decreased by 2% (P=.01). The physician concludes that the new medication decreases the risk for fracture in women aged 40 to 67 years. What is the most appropriate conclusion to draw from these data?]","Introduction
Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to increased bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures (Kanis 1994). In women aged 40–60 years—particularly those undergoing perimenopause—accelerated bone loss contributes to substantial fracture risk later in life (Riggs & Melton 1995). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of osteoporosis therapies often use surrogate endpoints such as bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) rather than fractures themselves, given the large sample sizes and long follow-up required to demonstrate reductions in fracture incidence (Prentice 1989). However, BMD changes do not always translate linearly into fracture risk reduction (Cummings et al. 1998). In the study under consideration, 300 osteoporotic women were randomized to receive a new osteoporosis medication versus placebo and followed for five years: BMD remained stable in the treatment group but declined 2% in the placebo group (P = .01). The physician’s conclusion—that the medication decreases fracture risk—is not directly supported by these data. The appropriate interpretation is that the medication prevents bone loss compared with placebo, but its effect on fracture incidence remains untested. This paper will (1) review osteoporosis pathophysiology and clinical outcomes, (2) examine surrogate endpoints and their validity, (3) critique the study’s design and outcomes, and (4) outline the correct conclusions and recommendations for future research.

Osteoporosis Pathophysiology and Clinical Outcomes
Osteoporosis results from an imbalance between bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts, leading to net bone loss (Clarke 2008). In pre‐ and perimenopausal women, estrogen deficiency accelerates bone turnover, reducing BMD at the hip, spine, and other skeletal sites (Riggs et al. 1982). Low BMD, as quantified by DEXA, has been shown to predict future fractures: each standard deviation decrease in BMD at the femoral neck doubles hip‐fracture risk (Cummings et al. 1998). Nonetheless, fractures are the clinically meaningful endpoints, as they confer morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs (Johnell & Kanis 2006). Thus, while BMD serves as a convenient surrogate, it does not capture other bone quality factors—such as microarchitecture, turnover rates, and mineralization—that influence bone strength and fracture risk (Seeman & Delmas 2006).

Surrogate Endpoints in Osteoporosis Trials
Surrogate endpoints are biomarkers intended to substitute for clinical outcomes, offering advantages in trial efficiency and cost (Prentice 1989). To qualify as a valid surrogate, changes in the surrogate must reliably predict changes in the clinical endpoint (regulatory guidance requires “biological plausibility, empirical evidence, and specificity” [Food and Drug Administration 2007]). In osteoporosis, BMD increase of ≥2–3% at the spine or hip correlates moderately with 30–50% fracture risk reduction for agents like bisphosphonates or selective estrogen‐receptor modulators (Black et al. 1996; Delmas et al. 1997). However, this relationship is agent‐specific: some interventions improve BMD without reducing fractures (e.g., fluoride) or reduce fractures via non‐BMD mechanisms (e.g., bone‐active monoclonal antibodies improving microarchitecture) (Seeman & Delmas 2006). Hence, RCTs using BMD as a surrogate must be interpreted in context of agent class and mechanism of action.

Study Design and Outcomes
In the described RCT, 300 women aged 40–60 with DEXA‐confirmed osteoporosis were randomized equally to new medication versus placebo and followed for five years with annual DEXA. The treatment group experienced no significant change in BMD, whereas the placebo group had a 2% annual decline (P = .01). Methodologically, the study demonstrates that the medication prevents bone loss compared to placebo, achieving statistical significance. Strengths include randomization, adequate follow‐up duration for BMD changes, and high internal validity. Limitations include absence of fracture data, reliance on a single surrogate endpoint, and lack of quality‐of‐life or safety outcomes—critical for holistic assessment of osteoporosis therapies (Lewiecki et al. 2008).

Interpretation of Bone Density Changes
A 2% difference in annual BMD loss is clinically modest but can accumulate over five years to a 10% advantage in bone mass preservation. Meta‐analyses suggest that each 1.0–1.5% per year greater BMD gain corresponds to approximately 8–15% reduction in vertebral fracture risk (Black et al. 1996; Ensrud et al. 2012). If the new medication’s mechanism mirrors bisphosphonates—through osteoclast inhibition—one might extrapolate potential fracture risk reduction. However, such extrapolation requires caution: heterogeneous drug effects, off‐target actions, and patient heterogeneity may alter risk profiles (Eastell et al. 2019). Without direct fracture data, any claim regarding fracture prevention remains speculative.

Correct Conclusion and Clinical Implications
Based solely on the presented data, the most appropriate conclusion is that the new osteoporosis medication prevents bone loss in women aged 40–60 years compared with placebo over five years, but its effect on fracture incidence has not been determined. Consequently, clinicians and patients should recognize the benefits in preserving bone density, while acknowledging the need for further evidence regarding fracture outcomes, safety, and cost‐effectiveness. Until fracture data are available—ideally from larger, event‐driven trials—the medication should be considered promising but investigational with respect to fracture prevention.

Recommendations for Future Research
To establish fracture risk reduction, future studies should:
Incorporate fracture endpoints as primary or co‐primary outcomes, with sufficient power to detect differences in vertebral and nonvertebral fractures (Johnell & Kanis 2006).


Assess bone quality using complementary modalities (e.g., high‐resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography, bone turnover markers) to elucidate mechanisms beyond BMD (Seeman & Delmas 2006).


Evaluate safety profiles, including rare but serious adverse events (e.g., atypical femur fractures, osteonecrosis of the jaw) over long‐term use (Eastell et al. 2019).


Perform cost‐utility analyses to determine the medication’s value relative to existing therapies (Boonen et al. 2004).


Such comprehensive assessment will inform guideline development and optimize osteoporosis management.

Conclusion
The randomized trial demonstrates that the new medication effectively halts bone density decline compared with placebo in osteoporotic women aged 40–60 years. However, no direct evidence supports the physician’s assertion that the medication decreases fracture risk, as fracture incidence was neither measured nor reported. A valid conclusion acknowledges the preservation of BMD while recognizing that fracture prevention remains unproven. Rigorous, fracture‐focused RCTs are warranted before endorsing this therapy for fracture risk reduction.

 Chest wall masses in adolescents encompass a diverse array of benign and malignant entities, among which Ewing sarcoma of the chest wall—historically termed “Askin tumor”—merits particular attention due to its aggressive behavior and distinctive histopathology. We present a 15-year-old boy with a 3-month history of left-sided chest wall swelling and pain, now manifesting as a fixed 14 × 12 cm tender mass. In this demographic and location, the most likely diagnosis is Ewing sarcoma of the chest wall. Biopsy is expected to reveal sheets of uniform small, round, blue tumor cells with scant cytoplasm, membranous CD99 (MIC2) positivity, periodic acid–Schiff–positive cytoplasmic glycogen, Homer Wright rosette formation, and the characteristic t(11;22)(q24;q12) EWS–FLI1 fusion gene. This paper reviews the epidemiology, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, histopathologic features, and molecular underpinnings of Ewing sarcoma in the chest wall, and discusses the rationale for targeted diagnostic evaluation and management.

Introduction
Adolescents presenting with chest wall masses pose a diagnostic challenge, encompassing benign lesions (lipomas, benign fibrous histiocytomas) and malignancies (osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphoma, metastatic neuroblastoma, and Ewing sarcoma family tumors). Among these, Ewing sarcoma (ES) is the second most common primary bone malignancy in children and adolescents and can present as a primary chest wall tumor—known as the Askin tumor—arising from ribs or soft tissues (Cotterill et al. 2000). ES typically afflicts patients aged 10–20 years, with a slight male predominance (Rodriguez-Galindo et al. 2008). Clinically, ES of the chest wall manifests as localized pain and swelling, occasionally accompanied by systemic “B” symptoms, though these were notably absent in our patient. Given the insidious onset over months and the chest wall location, the differential diagnosis narrows in favor of ES family tumors, and biopsy is imperative for definitive diagnosis.

Epidemiology and Clinical Presentation
Ewing sarcoma family tumors (ESFT) encompass classic ES of bone, extraosseous ES, primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), and Askin tumor of the thoracopulmonary region (Parham & Ellison 2006). ES accounts for approximately 10–15% of primary bone cancers in patients ≤20 years, with an estimated incidence of 2–3 per million per year in this age group (Shamberger et al. 2000). The thoracopulmonary location comprises 10–20% of ESFT cases, presenting as large, painful chest wall masses that can erode adjacent ribs and invade the pleura—features often visualized radiographically (Wooldridge et al. 2015).
Key clinical features of ESFT include:
Age: Predominantly 10–20 years; rare in <5 or >30 years (Rodriguez-Galindo et al. 2008).


Symptoms: Localized pain, swelling, tenderness; possible constitutional signs (fever, malaise) in up to 20% (Cotterill et al. 2000).


Imaging: Plain films may show lytic lesions with periosteal reaction (“onion‐skin”); CT/MRI delineates soft‐tissue extension; PET/CT for staging (Wooldridge et al. 2015).


In our 15-year-old patient, the gradual 3-month progression of chest wall swelling without systemic symptoms aligns with ESFT rather than an acute infection or trauma, and the fixed, tender mass suggests neoplastic infiltration.

Differential Diagnosis of Chest Wall Mass in Adolescents
The pediatric chest wall differential includes (Shamberger et al. 2000; Parham & Ellison 2006):
Benign tumors: Lipoma, fibroma, osteochondroma (rare in chest wall).


Bone malignancies:


Osteosarcoma: Malignant osteoid production; typically metaphyseal long bones, rare in ribs.


Ewing sarcoma (ES): Small round blue cells; can arise in ribs or soft tissue (Askin tumor).


Soft‐tissue sarcomas:


Rhabdomyosarcoma: Embryonal or alveolar subtypes; immunoreactive for myogenin, MyoD1.


Synovial sarcoma: Spindle cell morphology, t(X;18) translocation.


Lymphoma: Hodgkin/non‐Hodgkin involving chest wall; lymphadenopathy, B symptoms.


Metastatic tumors: Neuroblastoma (younger children), rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms tumor.


Histologic and immunohistochemical analysis is essential to distinguish among these entities, as clinical and radiographic findings alone lack specificity.

Histopathology of Ewing Sarcoma Family Tumors
Morphology
Biopsy of ESFT demonstrates:
Sheets of small, uniform round cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, finely dispersed (“salt-and-pepper”) chromatin, and scant clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm (the “small round blue cell” tumor pattern) (Parham & Ellison 2006).


Homer Wright rosettes: Tumor cells arrayed around central fibrillary processes, reflecting primitive neuroectodermal differentiation (Weiss & Goldblum 2001).


Immunohistochemistry
Characteristic immunoprofile includes:
Strong membranous CD99 (MIC2) positivity in >90% of cases (De Alava & Kovar 2000).


FLI1 nuclear positivity, reflecting the EWS–FLI1 fusion protein, in a high percentage (Tanaka et al. 1997).


Negative staining for markers of alternative diagnoses: desmin/Myogenin (rhabdomyosarcoma), cytokeratin (carcinoma), CD45 (lymphoma), and S100 (melanoma) (Parham & Ellison 2006).


Molecular Genetics
The pathognomonic genetic hallmark is the t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation, fusing the EWSR1 gene on chromosome 22 with the FLI1 transcription factor gene on chromosome 11, present in ~85% of ESFT (Delattre et al. 1992). Variants include EWSR1–ERG (t(21;22)) in ~10% of cases (Ng et al. 2007). Molecular confirmation can be obtained via RT‐PCR or FISH, supporting the immunohistochemical diagnosis.

Biopsy Findings in This Case
Given the clinical context—a 15-year-old boy with a tender, enlarging chest wall mass over months—Ewing sarcoma (Askin tumor) is most likely. The biopsy is expected to show (Parham & Ellison 2006; De Alava & Kovar 2000):
Uniform small round blue cells with scant cytoplasm and high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio.


Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS)–positive cytoplasmic glycogen in many cells.


Homer Wright rosettes in focal areas.


Diffuse membranous CD99 positivity and nuclear FLI1 immunoreactivity.


Demonstration of EWSR1–FLI1 fusion by molecular assays.


These features distinguish ESFT from other small round cell tumors of childhood and adolescence.

Implications for Management and Prognosis
Accurate histopathologic and molecular diagnosis guides multimodal therapy. Standard treatment of ESFT includes (Rodriguez-Galindo et al. 2008; Womer et al. 2012):
Induction chemotherapy (e.g., vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide alternated with ifosfamide, etoposide).


Local control via surgical resection when feasible, often preceded or followed by radiation therapy for positive margins or unresectable disease.


Consolidation chemotherapy and surveillance for recurrence.


Five‐year overall survival for localized ESFT approaches 70%, but chest wall location historically carried a worse prognosis due to challenges in achieving negative surgical margins and higher risk of thoracic relapse (Asami et al. 2003).

Conclusion
In a 15-year-old boy with a 3-month history of progressive left chest wall swelling and pain, the most likely diagnosis is Ewing sarcoma of the chest wall (Askin tumor). Biopsy will reveal sheets of uniform small round blue cells, Homer Wright rosettes, PAS-positive cytoplasmic glycogen, membranous CD99 positivity, and the EWSR1–FLI1 fusion. Recognition of these histopathologic and molecular features is critical to distinguish ESFT from other pediatric chest wall tumors and to initiate appropriate multimodal therapy, thereby optimizing clinical outcomes.

[A 20-year-old primigravid woman comes to the emergency department at 8 weeks' gestation because of a 2-day history of persistent nausea and vomiting with a 0.9kg (2lb) weight loss during this time. She also notes that she has not voided during the past 8 hours. She has not had fever, chills, or contact with anyone known to be ill. Medical history is unremarkable. She has taken prenatal vitamins sporadically during her pregnancy, but they worsen her nausea and vomiting. Temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 118/60 mm Hg. Oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Urine specific gravity is greater than 1.030 (N=1.003–1.036). What laboratory study results is most likely to be abnormal in this patient?]","Introduction
 Persistent nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy—beyond the typical “morning sickness”—can progress to hyperemesis gravidarum, characterized by dehydration, ketonuria, electrolyte disturbances, and weight loss (Sullivan & MacLennan 2020). Our 20-year-old primigravid patient at 8 weeks’ gestation presents with a 2-day history of relentless vomiting, a 0.9 kg weight loss, oliguria (no voiding for 8 hours), and a markedly elevated urine specific gravity (> 1.030), indicating significant intravascular volume depletion. In this setting, laboratory evaluation is critical to assess renal perfusion, acid–base status, and electrolyte balance. The most likely laboratory abnormality in this patient is an elevated blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio (BUN:Cr), reflecting prerenal azotemia from hypovolemia. This paper reviews the pathophysiology of hyperemesis gravidarum, the renal and metabolic consequences of dehydration, the expected laboratory derangements—including prerenal azotemia and contraction alkalosis—and the clinical implications for management.

Hyperemesis Gravidarum: Definitions and Pathophysiology
“Morning sickness” affects up to 80% of pregnant women, but hyperemesis gravidarum (HG)—the extreme end of this spectrum—occurs in approximately 0.3–2% of pregnancies (Brown & Hain 2014). HG is classically defined by:
Prolonged, intractable nausea and vomiting


Weight loss exceeding 5% of pre-pregnancy body weight


Evidence of dehydration (e.g., elevated urine specific gravity, oliguria)


Metabolic disturbances (ketonuria, electrolyte imbalances)


While the precise etiology remains multifactorial—hormonal (elevated β-hCG, estrogen), gastrointestinal dysmotility, and psychosocial factors—HG’s hallmark is persistent fluid loss leading to intravascular volume depletion (Sullivan & MacLennan 2020).

Renal Responses to Hypovolemia and Prerenal Azotemia
Physiology of Prerenal Azotemia
Intravascular volume contraction reduces renal perfusion pressure, triggering compensatory mechanisms:
Increased sympathetic tone → afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction


Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) activation → sodium and water retention


Sympathetic-mediated increased proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium and urea


These changes raise serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) disproportionately relative to serum creatinine (Cr), as urea reabsorption is enhanced while creatinine handling remains largely constant (Cheung & Wall 2010). Thus, BUN:Cr ratio > 20:1 is a classic marker of prerenal azotemia.
Expected Laboratory Findings in Prerenal Azotemia
Elevated BUN (e.g., 30–40 mg/dL)


Normal or mildly elevated serum creatinine (e.g., 1.0–1.2 mg/dL)


High BUN:Cr ratio (> 20:1)


Low fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) (< 1%)


Urine osmolality > 500 mOsm/kg, reflecting concentrated urine


In our patient—with oliguria and hypovolemia indicated by urine specific gravity > 1.030—these renal laboratory changes are anticipated.

Metabolic Consequences: Contraction Alkalosis and Electrolyte Disturbances
Metabolic Alkalosis (“Contraction Alkalosis”)
Persistent vomiting in HG causes loss of gastric HCl, leading to metabolic alkalosis. Volume depletion further concentrates serum bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) via RAAS-mediated sodium reabsorption (exchanging Na⁺ for H⁺) and H⁺ secretion in the proximal tubule, exacerbating alkalemia (Adrogué & Madias 2001). Laboratory manifestations include:
Elevated serum bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻ > 28 mEq/L)


Elevated blood pH (> 7.45) on arterial blood gas (ABG)


Compensatory hypoventilation (↑ PaCO₂)


Electrolyte Abnormalities
Gastric fluid loss and secondary hyperaldosteronism can produce:
Hypochloremia (Cl⁻ < 95 mEq/L) from HCl loss


Hyponatremia (Na⁺ < 135 mEq/L) from free water intake or hypotonic fluid replacement


Hypokalemia (K⁺ < 3.5 mEq/L) due to aldosterone-mediated K⁺ wasting


Ketosis detectable by elevated serum ketones and urine ketones


While these disturbances are frequent in HG, the earliest and most consistent laboratory abnormality reflecting the patient’s prerenal state is the elevated BUN:Cr ratio.

Clinical Correlation: Our Patient’s Presentation
Oliguria (no voiding for 8 hours) indicates reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and prerenal dysfunction.


Urine specific gravity > 1.030 confirms maximally concentrated urine—a renal response to volume depletion.


Weight loss of 0.9 kg over two days reflects fluid loss.


Absence of systemic infection signs and unremarkable physical exam argue against intrinsic renal or postrenal causes of azotemia.


Therefore, measurement of serum BUN and creatinine will likely reveal a BUN:Cr ratio exceeding 20:1, confirming prerenal azotemia from hypovolemia due to hyperemesis gravidarum.

Implications for Management
Recognition of prerenal azotemia and contraction alkalosis mandates prompt volume repletion to restore renal perfusion and correct acid–base and electrolyte imbalances:
Intravenous isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) to expand intravascular volume, improve GFR, and normalize BUN:Cr ratio (Sullivan & MacLennan 2020).


Electrolyte repletion: replace K⁺ and Cl⁻ as needed to correct hypokalemia and hypochloremia.


Antiemetic therapy (e.g., ondansetron, promethazine) and nutritional support (e.g., pyridoxine, doxylamine) to reduce ongoing losses.


Monitoring of BUN, creatinine, electrolytes, and acid–base status guides the adequacy of resuscitation and the prevention of progression to acute tubular necrosis.

Conclusion
In a dehydrated 20-year-old primigravid woman with hyperemesis gravidarum—evidenced by persistent vomiting, weight loss, oliguria, and highly concentrated urine—the most likely laboratory abnormality is an elevated BUN-to-creatinine ratio (> 20:1), reflecting prerenal azotemia. Secondary findings may include metabolic alkalosis with elevated bicarbonate and hypochloremia, but the BUN:Cr ratio is the hallmark of volume-depletion–induced renal hypoperfusion. Prompt recognition and correction of these laboratory derangements through volume and electrolyte repletion, coupled with antiemetic therapy, are essential to prevent intrinsic renal injury and ensure maternal–fetal well-being.

[A 60-year-old woman, who lives alone, is brought to the emergency department on a Friday evening by her next-door neighbor who says the patient has fallen several times during the past several days. An emergency department record from a visit 1 year ago for a minor laceration indicates that the patient has Parkinson disease with mild dementia, bipolar disorder, and hypertension. Her brother fills her weekly medication organizer, but he is overseas on a business trip for the week. The patient is unable to remember which medications she takes and whether there have been any changes recently to her medication regimen. The neighbor was unable to locate her pill organizer in her home, and the patient thinks her brother keeps her pill bottles at his house to prevent her from inadvertently taking extra doses. She has her brother's address on a card in her wallet, along with the names and phone numbers of her primary care physician, psychiatrist, and pharmacy. The medical record from her visit 8 year ago shows that her medications included clonazepam, clonidine, and lithium carbonate. Doses of each medication are also listed. Attempts to contact the patient's primary care physician and psychiatrist for more detailed medication history have been unsuccessful. What is the most appropriate initial approach to managing the patient's medications?]","Abstract
 Medication errors and adverse drug events are a leading cause of emergency department visits and hospitalizations among older adults, particularly those with cognitive impairment and polypharmacy (Gurwitz et al. 2003; Budnitz et al. 2007). Proper medication reconciliation—the systematic process of obtaining and verifying the complete and accurate list of a patient’s current medications—at transitions of care is a cornerstone of patient safety (Institute for Healthcare Improvement 2007; Gleason et al. 2010). We present the case of a 60-year-old woman with Parkinson disease, mild dementia, bipolar disorder, and hypertension, who lives alone and cannot recall her home medications; her weekly pill organizer is unavailable and her brother (who normally fills it) is out of town. Attempts to reach her prescribers have failed. The most appropriate initial approach is to contact her community pharmacy (or pharmacies) to obtain medication fill and dosing records, thereby reconstructing an accurate medication list before making any changes. This paper reviews the principles and evidence underpinning medication reconciliation in older adults, discusses challenges in cognitively impaired patients, examines the roles of various information sources (patient interview, “brown‐bag” review, pharmacy records, prescriber contacts), and justifies why pharmacy record retrieval is the optimal first step in this scenario.

Introduction
Older adults frequently face polypharmacy, defined as the concurrent use of five or more medications, which increases the risk of drug–drug interactions, adverse drug events, and falls (Maher et al. 2014; Fried et al. 2014). Patients with cognitive impairment and multiple comorbidities, like Parkinson disease and bipolar disorder, are particularly vulnerable (Mangoni & Jackson 2004). Medication reconciliation at each transition point—including the emergency department—is mandated by numerous safety organizations (The Joint Commission 2018; WHO High 5s 2010). In the absence of reliable patient‐provided information and unreachable prescribers, obtaining dispensing records from the patient’s pharmacy is the most accurate and efficient method to reconstruct her medication regimen (Wu et al. 2008).

Case Summary
A 60-year-old woman with a history of Parkinson disease, mild dementia, bipolar disorder, and hypertension fell multiple times over recent days and was brought to the emergency department. Her weekly pill organizer, normally filled by her brother (currently traveling overseas), could not be located, and she is unable to report which medications she takes or recent dose changes. An earlier record lists clonazepam, clonidine, and lithium carbonate, but the doses and any new prescriptions or discontinuations are unknown. Attempts to contact her primary care physician and psychiatrist have been unsuccessful.

Principles of Medication Reconciliation
Medication reconciliation is a five‐step standardized process (IHI Model):
Develop a complete medication list (including name, dose, frequency, route).


Develop the “best possible” list of what the patient should be taking (based on guidelines and clinical judgment).


Compare the two lists, identifying and resolving discrepancies (prescribing, transcription, dispensing, administration errors).


Create a new, reconciled list that is communicated to the patient and care team.


Document and explain changes to the patient and caregivers (Schnipper et al. 2009).


Each step is crucial to prevent omissions, duplications, dosing errors, and drug interactions.

Sources of Medication Information
1. Patient or Caregiver Report
Brown-bag review: Patients bring all medications in original containers; clinicians verify labels and contents (Greenwald et al. 2010).


Limitations: Not possible here—organizer and bottles unavailable; patient has dementia and poor recall.


2. Prescriber Records
Contacting the patient’s primary care provider and psychiatrist can yield the original prescriptions.


Limitation: Both were unreachable in a timely manner, and delays in contacting them risk patient safety in the interim (Boockvar et al. 2005).


3. Pharmacy Dispensing Records
Community pharmacies maintain electronic medication profiles including fill dates, dosages, quantities, and prescriber information.


Advantages: Objective, up‐to‐date records of what was dispensed; can identify all active prescriptions from multiple prescribers and pharmacies (Wu et al. 2008).


4. Health Information Exchange or Electronic Health Record (EHR)
In integrated systems, EHR medication lists may auto‐populate from e‐prescribing and pharmacy claims.


Limitation: Not universally available; may lag behind actual dispensing.



Evidence Supporting Pharmacy Record Retrieval
Accuracy: Studies show that pharmacist‐obtained community pharmacy records reduce medication discrepancies by up to 75%, whereas patient self‐report alone misses 50% of medications (Gleason et al. 2010).


Timeliness: Pharmacy records are typically accessible immediately via fax or electronic query, facilitating rapid reconciliation in emergency settings (Tam et al. 2012).


Safety: Implementing pharmacy record review on admission lowers adverse drug event rates and prescribing errors (Cornish et al. 2005).



Application to the Case
Given the unavailability of the pill organizer and the patient’s cognitive impairment:
Immediate Action: Contact the patient’s community pharmacy (or pharmacies)—information available from her wallet card or insurance—requesting her dispensing record for the prior 6–12 months.


Obtain Complete List: From the pharmacy, retrieve drug names, strengths, directions, fill dates, and prescriber names.


Verify with Patient: Show the medications (or photos) to the patient to confirm which she still takes and tolerates, adjusting for any known side effects.


Cross‐Check: When the PCP and psychiatrist become reachable, reconcile their intended regimen with the pharmacy list to identify any non‐adherence, dose changes, or new therapies.


Reconcile and Communicate: Generate a comprehensive medication list, educate the patient (and neighbor or other caregiver), and document changes in the medical record.


Only after this best possible medication history should clinicians consider holding, adjusting, or re‐initiating medications like lithium—where missing a dose poses a risk of mood destabilization—or clonidine—where abrupt discontinuation may cause rebound hypertension (Yudkin et al. 1999).

Discussion
Polypharmacy and Cognitive Impairment
Patients with dementia and multiple chronic conditions often cannot manage complex regimens (Christensen & Yankey 2012). Medication errors—including underuse of critical psychotropics or antihypertensives—can exacerbate falls, orthostatic hypotension, or mood instability (Zonfrillo et al. 2012). Hence, accurate lists are vital before changes.
Risk of Uninformed Medication Changes
Lithium: Abrupt cessation or overdose can precipitate bipolar relapse or toxicity, especially with dehydration (Gitlin 2016).


Clonidine: Abrupt discontinuation risks rebound hypertension (Vongpatanasin 2019).


Clonazepam: Missed doses can lead to withdrawal and increased fall risk; excessive dosing may worsen sedation and orthostasis.


Collaborative Solutions
Pharmacist Involvement: Clinical pharmacists in the ED can lead pharmacy record retrieval and initial reconciliation (Cornish et al. 2005).


Caregiver Engagement: Engage the neighbor and brother (by phone) in establishing a temporary pill organization and administration plan.


Health IT: Advocate for improved EHR‐pharmacy integration and use of regional health information exchanges to reduce reliance on patient recall (Vest & Gamm 2010).



Conclusion
In a 60-year-old woman with cognitive impairment, polypharmacy, and an incomplete medication picture, the most appropriate initial approach is to obtain her community pharmacy dispensing records to assemble the most accurate and up‐to‐date list of medications and dosages. This step adheres to evidence‐based medication reconciliation practices, minimizes the risk of adverse drug events, and provides a foundation for safe therapeutic decisions once prescriber intentions are confirmed. Early engagement of pharmacists, caregivers, and health information systems further enhances patient safety and continuity of care.

The patient is awake but is not oriented to person, place, or time. She is unable to speak coherently and becomes agitated and combative when a physical examination is attempted. What is the most appropriate initial intervention?]","Introduction
 Acute rectal bleeding in elderly patients often precipitates significant physiological and neurocognitive disturbances, compounded by comorbidities and baseline cognitive impairment (Strate & Gralnek, 2016). Delirium—a syndrome of acute inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness—occurs in up to 40% of hospitalized older adults and is associated with increased morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and higher mortality (Inouye et al., 2014). Management of delirium begins with identification and treatment of underlying precipitants (e.g., hypovolemia, infection, metabolic derangement) alongside nonpharmacologic interventions to ensure patient safety and minimize distress (Marcantonio, 2017). We present the case of an 88-year-old woman with advanced dementia, multiple strokes, and chronic renal disease who developed rectal bleeding and, within four hours, became acutely agitated and delirious, precluding physical examination. The most appropriate initial intervention is to implement nonpharmacologic delirium management strategies, specifically “reorientation and family‐based comfort measures” while simultaneously initiating hemodynamic stabilization and diagnostic evaluation.

Case Summary
An 88-year-old woman with long‐standing dementia due to multiple prior strokes resides in a nursing care facility. Her chronic conditions include coronary artery disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and stage 3 chronic kidney disease; medications are aspirin 81 mg daily, simvastatin, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. Four hours after an episode of rectal bleeding noted by facility staff, she is transferred to the emergency department.
On arrival, her vital signs are: T 37.2 °C, HR 102 /min, RR 20 /min, BP 105/60 mm Hg, SpO₂ 95% on room air. She is awake but disoriented, nonverbal, and combative with attempts at examination. She cannot provide history. Caregivers report no fever, infection risk exposures, or medication changes in the past week. Laboratory and hemodynamic workup is pending.

Delirium in the Elderly: Definitions and Impact
Delirium is defined by the DSM-5 as a disturbance in attention and awareness developing over a short time, fluctuating in severity, and accompanied by cognitive change not better accounted for by a preexisting neurocognitive disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). While patients with baseline dementia are at high risk for delirium, distinguishing delirium superimposed on dementia is critical given its reversible causes and prognostic implications (Fong et al., 2015).
Delirium affects 14–56% of older adults in the emergency department and hospital wards (Han et al., 2013), and is associated with:
↑ In‐hospital complications (falls, pressure ulcers)


↑ Length of stay (by 4–6 days)


↑ Institutionalization rates


↑ 6‐month and 1‐year mortality (Leslie et al., 2008)


Early recognition and prompt management reduce delirium duration and adverse outcomes (Inouye et al., 1999).

Precipitants of Delirium in This Patient
Delirium is multifactorial; common precipitants include:
Acute medical illness: Hypovolemia from acute blood loss can lead to cerebral hypoperfusion and metabolic derangements (Marcantonio, 2017).


Medications: Anticholinergics, sedatives, and polypharmacy increase delirium risk; however, this patient’s chronic medications (ACE inhibitor, statin, thiazide, low-dose aspirin) are less likely acute precipitants.


Sensory Deprivation: Dementia and unfamiliar environment (ED) exacerbate disorientation (Flaherty et al., 2003).


Metabolic: Electrolyte disturbances from volume loss, renal dysfunction.


In this scenario, acute hypovolemia and environmental stress are likely dominant contributors.

Principles of Initial Delirium Management
Identify and treat underlying causes (ABCDE approach):


Airway


Breathing


Circulation: Assess for hypovolemia; obtain IV access, fluids


Disability (neurologic status; glucose, electrolytes)


Exposure (infection, trauma) (Inouye et al., 2014)


Nonpharmacologic interventions are first-line to reorient and calm the patient (Hshieh et al., 2015):


Provide a quiet, well‐lit environment with clock and calendar visible


Ensure use of eyeglasses and hearing aids


Maintain sleep‐wake cycle (minimize nighttime disturbances)


Engage a family member or familiar caregiver for reassurance and reorientation


Use gentle verbal cues, frequent reassurance, and avoid restraints


Pharmacologic therapy (antipsychotics) is reserved for patients with severe agitation posing immediate risk to self or staff, and after nonpharmacologic measures have been attempted (Cochrane Review; Neufeld et al., 2016).



Rationale for Nonpharmacologic First Response
Evidence Base
Multi‐component nonpharmacologic bundles reduce delirium incidence by 40%, shorten duration by 0.6 days, and decrease falls (Inouye et al., 1999; Hshieh et al., 2015).


Family‐engagement and “reorientation” strategies improve patient cooperation and decrease need for chemical restraints (Flaherty et al., 2003).


Sedative medications (e.g., haloperidol) carry risks of extrapyramidal symptoms, QT prolongation, and may worsen mortality (Woolcott et al., 2009).


Application to Case
While awaiting hemodynamic stabilization (IV fluids, labs), the patient’s agitation precludes examination. Immediate environmental and supportive measures—such as having a familiar nurse or family member speak calmly, reorienting to place and time, and ensuring sensory aids—can reduce agitation, allowing vital signs monitoring and physical exam (Yam et al., 2012).

Proposed Initial Intervention
Implement nonpharmacologic delirium management by:
Contacting the patient’s primary caregiver or family member to bring familiar items (photos, blanket), reorient her verbally, and stay at bedside.


Ensuring sensory aids (glasses, hearing aids) are in place.


Reducing environmental stimuli: dimming lights, minimizing noise, clustering care to allow uninterrupted rest.


Providing clear, simple reorientation cues: “You are in the emergency department; my name is ___; we are here to help you.”


Simultaneously initiate IV access and isotonic fluid resuscitation for suspected hypovolemia to address underlying cause.


Only if agitation persists after these measures and poses safety risks should low‐dose antipsychotic (e.g., haloperidol 0.5–1 mg IV) be considered (Neufeld et al., 2016).

Discussion
Safety and Ethics
Chemical restraints increase risk of stroke and death in dementia (Maust et al., 2015).


Physical restraints lead to deconditioning and pressure ulcers (Mion et al., 2014).


Nonpharmacologic approaches respect patient autonomy and dignity, and align with geriatric care best practices.
Coordination of Care
Engage multidisciplinary team: nursing, geriatric medicine, pharmacy, social work.


Communicate plan to nursing facility to maintain reorientation strategies post‐transfer.



Conclusion
In an 88‐year‐old woman with dementia and acute rectal bleeding who becomes delirious and combative, the most appropriate initial intervention is to implement nonpharmacologic delirium management—family‐based reorientation, sensory optimization, environmental modifications—while concurrently addressing the underlying hypovolemia with fluid resuscitation. This approach is supported by robust evidence for reducing delirium severity and duration and minimizing adverse medication effects. Pharmacologic sedation should be reserved for refractory agitation threatening safety.

What is the most likely diagnosis?]","Introduction
Pancoast tumors—also known as superior sulcus tumors—are rare, malignant neoplasms arising at the apex of the lung that invade adjacent structures of the thoracic inlet, producing characteristic signs and symptoms related to local extension (1). Typically affecting older adults with a history of heavy smoking, these tumors classically present with shoulder and arm pain, hand muscle weakness, and ipsilateral Horner syndrome due to involvement of the brachial plexus and sympathetic chain (2). We present the case of a 56-year-old man with a 3-week history of right arm weakness and right-sided ptosis, whose examination reveals right upper-limb muscle weakness and ipsilateral miosis—features pointing to a Pancoast tumor. This paper reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of Pancoast tumors, highlighting the importance of early recognition and multidisciplinary treatment.

Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Pancoast tumors account for approximately 3–5% of all bronchogenic carcinomas (3). The vast majority (over 90%) are non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), with squamous cell carcinoma being most common, followed by adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma (4). The principal risk factor is a long history of cigarette smoking; nearly all patients have significant tobacco exposure (5). Our patient’s 40-pack-year smoking history places him squarely within the high-risk population for superior sulcus tumors.

Anatomy and Pathophysiology
Location and Local Invasion
Superior sulcus tumors originate in the apex of the lung parenchyma—within the thoracic inlet—where they may invade adjacent structures including:
Brachial plexus (C8–T1 nerve roots), causing severe shoulder and upper-limb pain and motor weakness in intrinsic hand muscles (2).


Stellate (cervicothoracic) ganglion and sympathetic chain, producing ipsilateral Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis).


Vertebral bodies and ribs, leading to structural pain and spinal cord compression in advanced cases (6).


The combination of brachial plexopathy and sympathetic involvement produces the characteristic clinical syndrome.

Clinical Presentation
Brachial Plexus Involvement
Patients often report severe, refractory shoulder or scapular pain, radiating down the medial aspect of the arm into the ulnar distribution—reflecting C8–T1 nerve root compression. Progressive motor deficits emerge, typically affecting hand intrinsic muscles and grip strength, as seen in our patient’s 3/5 finger flexor and grip weakness on the right (2,7).
Horner Syndrome
Involvement of the sympathetic chain at the thoracic inlet yields an ipsilateral Horner syndrome—ptosis (drooping eyelid), miosis (constricted pupil), and facial anhidrosis. Our patient’s right-sided ptosis and a right pupil measuring 4 mm versus 5 mm on the left, reactive to light and accommodation, confirm the clinical diagnosis (8).
Constitutional and Respiratory Symptoms
Cough, hemoptysis, and weight loss may develop but often appear later in the disease course. In early presentations, local neurologic signs predominate, leading to delayed recognition of the underlying malignancy (2).

Diagnostic Evaluation
Imaging
Chest Radiography


May reveal an apical opacity or blunting of the lung apex, though up to 30% of cases are missed on standard films (9).


Contrast-Enhanced CT Scan


Provides detailed assessment of tumor size, invasion into nearby structures (ribs, vertebrae, brachial plexus), and mediastinal lymphadenopathy (10).


MRI of the Brachial Plexus and Thoracic Inlet


Superior for evaluating neural and vascular invasion, particularly for surgical planning (11).


PET-CT


Assesses metabolic activity, distant metastases, and nodal involvement to inform staging (12).


Tissue Diagnosis
CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy of the apical mass is the standard means of obtaining histologic confirmation prior to definitive therapy (13).



Staging and Prognosis
Pancoast tumors are staged using the TNM system for NSCLC. Many present as T3 (invasion of chest wall) or T4 (invasion of vertebrae or subclavian vessels) lesions, often with N0–N1 nodal status if detected early (14). Historically, the prognosis was poor, with 5-year survival below 10%. However, trimodality therapy—combining induction chemoradiation followed by surgical resection—has improved 5-year survival rates to 30–50% in selected patients (15).

Management
Multimodal Approach
Neoadjuvant (Induction) Chemoradiation


Concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy (e.g., cisplatin) with thoracic radiotherapy (45 Gy) to downstage the tumor and sterilize microscopic disease (15).


Surgical Resection


En bloc resection of the upper lobectomy plus involved chest wall (ribs, vertebrae) is performed 4–6 weeks post-chemoradiation if restaging shows adequate response (16).


Adjuvant Therapy


Additional chemotherapy may be administered based on final pathologic staging.


Supportive Care
Pain management with neuropathic agents, opioids, and interventional procedures (nerve blocks) is essential for quality of life (17).


Physical and occupational therapy to maximize residual function in the affected limb.



Differential Diagnosis
Cervical spinal cord compression (e.g., metastatic disease) can cause upper-limb weakness but typically involves long-tract signs and bilateral symptoms (18).


Myasthenia gravis produces ptosis and limb weakness but spares pupils and has fluctuating symptoms worsened by exertion (19).


Diabetic neuropathy can affect the brachial plexus (brachial plexopathy), but is uncommon and does not produce Horner syndrome (20).


The combination of brachial plexus motor deficits with ipsilateral Horner syndrome in a heavy smoker is pathognomonic for a Pancoast tumor until proven otherwise.

Conclusion
In a 56-year-old man with a significant smoking history who presents with unilateral hand weakness and ipsilateral ptosis and miosis, the most likely diagnosis is a Pancoast (superior sulcus) tumor of the right lung apex invading the brachial plexus and sympathetic chain. Early recognition and a multidisciplinary management strategy—including neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgical resection—offer the best chance of long-term survival. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for apical lung tumors in patients with upper-limb neurologic deficits and Horner syndrome, even in the absence of overt pulmonary symptoms.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common and severe form of muscular dystrophy, affecting approximately 1 in 3,500 live male births worldwide (Mah JK et al. 2014). Characterized by progressive proximal muscle weakness, early loss of ambulation, pseudohypertrophy of calf muscles, and elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels, DMD typically presents in early childhood (Emery AE 2002). Additionally, up to one-third of affected boys exhibit mild cognitive impairment due to the role of dystrophin isoforms in the central nervous system (Chaussenot R et al. 2018). The underlying cause is mutations in the dystrophin gene (DMD) on chromosome Xp21, most commonly large deletions that disrupt the translational reading frame, leading to absence of functional dystrophin protein (Koenig M et al. 1987). In this paper, we review the clinical presentation, molecular genetics, pathophysiology, and diagnostic approaches for DMD, concluding that the most likely mutation in the presented 5-year-old boy is a frameshift deletion in the dystrophin gene resulting in a truncated, nonfunctional dystrophin protein.

Clinical Presentation of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
Age of Onset and Early Signs
DMD typically manifests between ages 3 and 5 years with delayed motor milestones, difficulty rising from the floor, and challenges with stair climbing or running (Emery AE 2002). The “Gowers’ sign”—using the arms to “walk up” the thighs when rising—is a pathognomonic finding reflecting pelvic girdle weakness (Thomas FP & Thomas PW 2016). In our case, the boy’s progressive difficulty climbing stairs and rising from a chair over two months, combined with delayed motor milestones, strongly suggest DMD.
Muscle Findings
On physical examination, children with DMD exhibit:
Proximal muscle weakness (pelvic girdle > shoulder girdle)


Calf pseudohypertrophy due to fatty infiltration and fibrosis of the gastrocnemius


Waddling gait and lumbar lordosis


Loss of ambulation typically by early teens without intervention


Our patient’s bilateral calf enlargement and 3/5 strength in hip girdle muscles, with otherwise normal reflexes, align with these findings.
Cognitive Involvement
Approximately 20–35% of boys with DMD have cognitive deficits—particularly in verbal IQ and executive function—due to deficiency of dystrophin isoforms in the brain (Chaussenot R et al. 2018). The patient’s mild cognitive delay requiring academic assistance is consistent with this genotype–phenotype correlation.
Laboratory Findings
Serum CK levels in DMD are markedly elevated—often 10–100 times the upper limit of normal—reflecting ongoing muscle fiber necrosis (Connolly AM et al. 2015). A CK of 25,000 U/L in our patient (normal 20–200 U/L) is characteristic of DMD.

Molecular Genetics of DMD
The Dystrophin Gene
The DMD gene is the largest human gene—spanning 2.2 Mb with 79 exons—encoding dystrophin, a 427 kDa cytoskeletal protein that stabilizes the sarcolemma by linking the intracellular actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix via the dystrophin‐glycoprotein complex (Ervasti JM & Campbell KP 1991). Loss of dystrophin increases membrane fragility, leading to muscle fiber degeneration and replacement with fat and connective tissue.
Mutation Spectrum
Over 70% of DMD patients harbor large deletions of one or more exons; ~10% have large duplications; the remainder possess point mutations (nonsense, frameshift, splice‐site) (Flanigan KM et al. 2009). “Reading‐frame rule”: out‐of‐frame deletions/duplications abolish dystrophin production, causing DMD, whereas in‐frame mutations permit residual dystrophin expression, resulting in the milder Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) phenotype (Koenig M et al. 1989).
Frameshift Deletions in DMD
In DMD, most deletions disrupt the mRNA reading frame, eliciting nonsense‐mediated decay or truncated dystrophin lacking the C‐terminal domains essential for membrane localization (Koenig M et al. 1987). For example, deletion of exons 45–50 induces a frameshift, abolishing functional protein. Such frameshift mutations are the prototypical DMD‐causing lesions.

Diagnostic Approach
Genetic Testing
Multiplex ligation‐dependent probe amplification (MLPA): Detects exon‐level deletions/duplications across all 79 exons with high sensitivity (~75% detection rate for deletions, ~10% for duplications) (Hyde SA & Flanigan KM 2017).


Next‐generation sequencing (NGS) or Sanger sequencing: Identifies point mutations (nonsense, frameshift, splice‐site) when MLPA is negative.


mRNA analysis: Confirms aberrant splicing in suspected splice‐site mutations (He XL et al. 2009).


Given the deletion prevalence, MLPA is the first‐line assay; a frameshift deletion will be identified in the majority of DMD cases.
Muscle Biopsy and Western Blot
Historically, immunostaining for dystrophin on muscle biopsy and Western blot quantification confirmed absent or reduced dystrophin levels, but genetic testing has largely supplanted biopsy (Mercuri E & Muntoni F 2013).

Pathophysiology of Dystrophin Deficiency
Without dystrophin, contraction‐induced stress causes sarcolemmal tears and calcium influx, triggering proteolytic cascades, inflammation, and myonecrosis (Allen DG et al. 2016). Repeated cycles of degeneration and regeneration exhaust satellite cells, culminating in replacement of muscle with fat and fibrosis, manifesting as pseudohypertrophy—particularly in the calves.

Genotype–Phenotype Correlation
The nature and location of DMD gene mutations influence disease severity and progression:
Out‐of‐frame deletions yield classic DMD with early onset, rapid progression, and severe weakness (Emery AE 2002).


In‐frame deletions result in BMD, presenting later in adolescence or adulthood with milder symptoms and slower progression (Koenig M et al. 1989).


Nonsense mutations (premature stop codons) similarly abrogate dystrophin production, causing DMD (Flanigan KM et al. 2009).


Our patient’s early childhood onset, rapid progression over two months, and severely elevated CK strongly favor a frameshift or nonsense mutation rather than an in‐frame deletion.

Treatment and Emerging Therapies
While no cure exists, multidisciplinary care—corticosteroids, physical therapy, and cardiac/pulmonary surveillance—prolongs ambulation and life expectancy (Bushby K et al. 2010). Molecular therapies targeting specific mutations have emerged:
Stop codon read‐through agents: Ataluren promotes ribosomal read‐through of premature stop codons for nonsense mutations (Bushby K et al. 2014).


Exon skipping: Antisense oligonucleotides (e.g., eteplirsen) restore the reading frame by skipping mutated exons (Mendell JR et al. 2013).


Gene therapy: Micro‐dystrophin delivery via adeno‐associated virus vectors is under clinical investigation (Mendell JR et al. 2020).


These approaches depend on precise mutation identification, underscoring the importance of genetic testing.

Conclusion
The clinical features—onset in early childhood, proximal muscle weakness, Gowers’ sign, calf pseudohypertrophy, cognitive delay, and markedly elevated CK—are diagnostic of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The most likely underlying genetic lesion is an out‐of‐frame deletion (frameshift) in the dystrophin gene on Xp21, leading to absence of functional dystrophin protein. Multiplex ligation‐dependent probe amplification will most readily identify such deletions. Accurate molecular diagnosis informs prognosis, genetic counseling, and eligibility for emerging mutation‐specific therapies.

An upper gastrointestinal series 8 month ago showed no abnormalities. The patient requests an endoscopy because she read about them while researching her symptoms on the Internet. What is the most appropriate next step in management?]”","Introduction
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) affects up to 20% of adults in Western populations, manifesting as heartburn, regurgitation, and upper abdominal discomfort (El-Serag et al. 2014). While most patients respond to lifestyle modification and proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, a subset remains symptomatic—often due to poor adherence, inadequate dosing, or unrealistic expectations (Katz et al. 2013). Barrett esophagus, a premalignant complication of chronic GERD, warrants endoscopic surveillance; however, guidelines reserve endoscopy for patients with alarm features or prolonged, uncontrolled reflux of at least 5 years, particularly in those over age 50 with multiple risk factors (Spechler et al. 2016). We present a 54-year-old woman with a 10-month history of moderate to severe heartburn and postprandial nausea, minimal self-directed lifestyle changes, uncertain PPI dosing, and anxiety about Barrett esophagus. Despite fascination with endoscopy gleaned online, she lacks both alarm features and the requisite duration of documented reflux. The most appropriate next step is to reassess and optimize medical therapy—ensuring correct PPI dosing and reinforcing lifestyle modifications—before considering endoscopy.

Epidemiology and Natural History of GERD
GERD arises from transient or chronic dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), impaired esophageal clearance, and anatomic factors such as hiatal hernia (Dent et al. 2010). In population surveys, weekly heartburn affects 10–20% of adults, with prevalence increasing with age and obesity (El-Serag et al. 2014). While most patients attain symptom relief with lifestyle measures (weight loss, head-of-bed elevation, dietary modifications) and a standard 8-week course of PPI therapy, up to 30% have persistent symptoms, necessitating further evaluation (Katz et al. 2013).

Pathophysiology and Complications
Acidic gastric contents reflux into the esophagus, damaging the squamous mucosa and eliciting symptoms. Chronic acid exposure can lead to erosive esophagitis, peptic strictures, and Barrett esophagus—the replacement of normal squamous epithelium with specialized intestinal metaplasia, which carries a 0.1–0.5% annual risk of progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma (Spechler et al. 2016). Key risk factors for Barrett transformation include:
Duration of GERD symptoms ≥5 years


Age >50 years


Obesity, particularly central adiposity


Male sex and white race (Ronkainen et al. 2005)


Our patient’s only risk factors are age >50 and BMI 29 kg/m², but her GERD history spans only 10 months—insufficient to meet screening criteria.

Clinical Evaluation and Differential Diagnosis
Symptom Assessment
A thorough history differentiates typical (heartburn, acid regurgitation) from atypical (chest pain, cough) GERD presentations. Alarm features—dysphagia, odynophagia, gastrointestinal bleeding, weight loss—trigger prompt endoscopic evaluation (Katz et al. 2013). This patient denies dysphagia or bleeding and has only mild postprandial nausea.
Response to Therapy
Failure of PPI therapy may reflect:
Nonadherence or improper dosing


Incorrect timing (PPIs should be taken 30–60 minutes before the first meal)


Nonacid reflux or functional heartburn requiring alternative approaches (Vaezi et al. 2007)


Our patient is uncertain of her omeprazole dosing and has not adhered to lifestyle advice, making poor adherence the leading cause of her persistent symptoms.
Exclusion of Other Causes
An upper gastrointestinal series a month prior was normal, ruling out gross structural lesions but lacking sensitivity for Barrett esophagus or mild esophagitis (Enns & Castell 1999). Endoscopy remains the gold standard for mucosal evaluation but carries cost, risk, and opportunity trade-offs in low-yield settings.

Management Guidelines
Lifestyle Modification
First-line interventions include:
Weight loss for overweight/obese patients (1 BMI unit lost reduces heartburn frequency by ~10%)


Dietary changes: avoiding trigger foods (caffeine, chocolate, fatty meals) and large evening meals


Head-of-bed elevation and avoiding recumbency within 3 hours of meals (Kaltenbach et al. 2006)


The patient has made minimal lifestyle changes; reinforcing these measures is critical before proceeding to invasive evaluation.
Pharmacologic Therapy
PPIs are the treatment of choice for moderate to severe GERD:
Standard dosing: omeprazole 20 mg once daily, taken before breakfast, for 8 weeks (Katz et al. 2013).


For partial responders: dose doubling or switching to a different PPI can be attempted (Vaezi et al. 2007).


Our patient’s uncertain daily dosing and timing may render therapy ineffective; establishing a clear regimen is paramount.
Indications for Endoscopy
The American College of Gastroenterology recommends upper endoscopy in:
Patients with alarm features


Persistent reflux despite 6–8 weeks of optimized PPI therapy


Screening for Barrett esophagus only in those with chronic (>5 years) symptoms plus risk factors (Katz et al. 2013).


Endoscopy in this patient without alarm features or requisite symptom duration would constitute overuse, expose her to procedural risk, and not align with guideline-based care.

Addressing Patient Anxiety and Expectations
Patients often obtain health information online, leading to self-diagnosis and procedural requests (McMullan 2006). Effective management requires:
Empathetic communication, acknowledging her distress and validating her experience (Wolters et al. 2013).


Shared decision-making, explaining the risks, benefits, and likelihood of diagnostic yield for endoscopy at this stage (Elwyn et al. 2012).


Setting short-term goals, such as trial of optimized PPI and lifestyle modification, with planned re-assessment in 8 weeks before pursuing endoscopy.


This approach improves adherence, reduces unnecessary procedures, and addresses her anxiety about Barrett esophagus.

Proposed Next Step
Optimize medical management by:
Clarifying and prescribing omeprazole 20 mg once daily, to be taken 30 minutes before breakfast, for 8 weeks.


Providing written and verbal counseling on specific dietary triggers, weight loss targets, and head-of-bed elevation.


Arranging follow-up in 8 weeks to assess symptom resolution and discuss the need for endoscopy if symptoms persist.


During this period, reassure the patient that Barrett esophagus screening is unwarranted until chronicity and risk profile criteria are met.

Conclusion
In a 54-year-old woman with a 10-month history of moderate to severe reflux symptoms, minimal lifestyle change, uncertain PPI adherence, and no alarm features, the most appropriate next step is to optimize and reinforce adherence to PPI therapy and lifestyle modifications for a full 8-week trial, rather than immediate endoscopy. This strategy aligns with evidence-based GERD management guidelines, maximizes therapeutic benefit, respects patient safety, and addresses her concerns through shared decision-making.

She has never been pregnant, but she is considering pregnancy and wants to know her risk for transmitting HIV to future children. What is the most accurate statement?]""","Abstract
 Perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a critical concern for HIV‐infected women contemplating pregnancy. In the absence of any intervention, vertical transmission rates range from 15–45% (Connor et al. 1994). However, with modern antiretroviral therapy (ART), elective cesarean delivery when indicated, and avoidance of breastfeeding, perinatal transmission can be reduced to less than 1% in high‐resource settings (Davey et al. 1999; Townsend et al. 2008). We present the case of a 29‐year‐old woman with newly diagnosed HIV infection, a CD4+ T‐lymphocyte count of 800 cells/mm³, and undetectable plasma HIV RNA, who is considering future pregnancy. The most accurate statement is that with continued suppressive ART throughout pregnancy, appropriate obstetric management, and avoidance of breastfeeding, her risk of transmitting HIV to her child is less than 1%. This paper reviews the epidemiology and pathophysiology of vertical HIV transmission, the impact of maternal viral load, the evidence behind ART regimens in pregnancy, and recommendations for obstetric and neonatal management to minimize perinatal HIV transmission risk.

Introduction
Vertical (mother‐to‐child) transmission of HIV occurs in utero, intrapartum, and via breastfeeding (26%, 66%, and 9% of perinatal infections, respectively) (Kourtis et al. 2013). Without any interventions, the cumulative risk of transmission is 15–45% (WHO 2010). Antiretroviral prophylaxis, cesarean delivery when maternal viral load is not suppressed, and avoidance of breastfeeding dramatically reduce this risk to below 1% in resource‐rich settings (Connor et al. 1994; Moodley et al. 2011). The patient under discussion, with a high CD4 count and sustained virologic suppression, falls into the lowest‐risk category, provided optimal management is maintained.

Epidemiology of Perinatal HIV Transmission
Natural History Without Intervention
Seminal randomized trials in the early 1990s demonstrated that zidovudine (ZDV) monotherapy reduced perinatal HIV transmission from ~25% to ~8% (ACTG Protocol 076) (Connor et al. 1994). Subsequent longitudinal cohorts without any ART reported transmission risks of up to 45% when breastfeeding was included (Jackson et al. 2003).
Impact of Combination ART
With the advent of potent combination ART (cART) and routine viral load monitoring, several studies in the 2000s demonstrated perinatal transmission rates of <2% when maternal viral load was suppressed below detection (e.g., <400 copies/mL) at delivery (Davey et al. 1999; Townsend et al. 2008). National registry data from the United Kingdom and Ireland—where universal ART and avoidance of breastfeeding are standard—showed a perinatal HIV transmission rate of 0.46% among women on suppressive ART (Townsend et al. 2008).

Mechanisms and Timing of Transmission
In utero (transplacental): Approximately 5–10% of transmissions occur before labor (Freeman et al. 2006).


Intrapartum (during delivery): The highest risk period—60–70%—due to fetal exposure to HIV‐infected maternal blood and genital secretions (European Mode of Delivery Collaboration 1999).


Postpartum via breastfeeding: In resource‐limited settings where breastfeeding is common, accounts for ~9–16% risk (Kourtis et al. 2006).


Effective maternal viral suppression and avoidance of breastfeeding eliminate the latter two major routes of transmission in high‐resource settings.

Maternal Viral Load and Transmission Risk
Maternal plasma HIV RNA level is the single strongest predictor of perinatal transmission (Magee et al. 2015). Studies show:
Viral load >100,000 copies/mL at delivery: transmission risk ~7–11%


Viral load 1,000–10,000 copies/mL: risk ~1–2%


Viral load <50 copies/mL (undetectable): risk <1% (Blattner et al. 2000; Lallemant et al. 2007)


Our patient’s undetectable HIV RNA and CD4 count of 800 cells/mm³ portend an excellent prognosis for minimizing vertical transmission.

Antiretroviral Therapy in Pregnancy
Initiation and Selection
All pregnant women with HIV should initiate or continue cART as soon as possible, regardless of CD4 count, to achieve and maintain viral suppression (Panel on Treatment of Pregnant Women with HIV Infection and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission 2018).


Preferred regimens include two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., ZDV + lamivudine) plus a protease inhibitor (e.g., lopinavir/ritonavir) or an integrase inhibitor (e.g., raltegravir) based on safety and pharmacokinetics in pregnancy (Cohen et al. 2016).


Timing
In utero suppression: Early viral load reduction decreases in utero transmission risk.


Labor and delivery: Maintaining suppression at the time of delivery is critical; scheduled cesarean at 38 weeks is recommended if viral load >1,000 copies/mL (European Mode of Delivery Collaboration 1999).



Obstetric Management
Mode of Delivery
Cesarean delivery: Reduces intrapartum transmission when maternal viral load >1,000 copies/mL (AAP/ACOG guidelines).


Vaginal delivery: Safe if viral load <1,000 copies/mL and no obstetric contraindications (Cohen et al. 2016).


Intrapartum Prophylaxis
Intravenous ZDV during labor for women with viral load >1,000 copies/mL; optional if suppressed (Panel on Treatment of Pregnant Women with HIV Infection and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission 2018).



Neonatal Prophylaxis and Feeding
Infant prophylaxis: ZDV for 4–6 weeks, with the addition of nevirapine for high‐risk infants (e.g., maternal viral load >1,000 copies/mL or unknown) (Neson et al. 2007).


Feeding: In high‐resource settings, exclusive formula feeding is recommended to eliminate postnatal HIV transmission (WHO 2010). In resource‐limited settings, exclusive breastfeeding with maternal or infant prophylaxis for at least 6 months is advised to balance HIV risk against malnutrition and other infectious hazards (Coutsoudis et al. 2002).



Counseling and Risk Communication
Effective patient counseling should include:
Baseline risk without interventions (15–45%).


Reduction to <1% with sustained viral suppression on ART, appropriate delivery planning, and formula feeding (Townsend et al. 2008).


Importance of adherence to ART and regular prenatal care with viral load monitoring.


Neonatal prophylaxis and infant HIV testing schedule (PCR at birth, 4–6 weeks, 3 months, and serology at 18 months) (Abu-Raddad et al. 2012).



Answer to the Clinical Question
With effective, continuous ART resulting in undetectable plasma HIV RNA levels, avoidance of breastfeeding, and appropriate obstetric management, the risk of perinatal HIV transmission is less than 1%.

Conclusion
Advances in ART and perinatal HIV management have transformed vertical transmission from a frequent outcome into a rare event in high‐resource settings. For HIV‐infected women with sustained virologic suppression—like our patient with a CD4 count of 800 cells/mm³ and undetectable HIV RNA—the risk of transmitting HIV to their child can be reduced to below 1% with optimal medical and obstetric care. This data informs preconception counseling, empowering women to make evidence‐based reproductive decisions while maintaining their own health and minimizing perinatal HIV risk.

[A 50-year-old woman who has been your patient for the past 3 years comes to the office because of heartburn and increased belching and bloating after meals for the past month. Antacids provide little relief. The symptoms tend to occur after eating. She is currently asymptomatic. She has never had an operation. The patient identifies as African American. Physical examination shows mild scleral icterus and a 11-cm mass in the epigastric area. What is the most appropriate initial diagnostic study?]""","Introduction
Upper abdominal discomfort—particularly postprandial heartburn, belching, and bloating—is often attributed to benign gastroesophageal reflux or functional dyspepsia (Talley & Ford 2015). However, when such symptoms present alongside jaundice and a palpable epigastric mass in a middle‐aged patient, clinicians must broaden their differential to include obstructive biliary pathology, most notably malignancies at the head of the pancreas (Pancreatic Cancer Action Network 2019). The combination of painless jaundice and a palpable gallbladder—Courvoisier’s sign—is classically associated with extrahepatic biliary obstruction due to carcinoma of the pancreatic head or distal bile duct (Courvoisier 1890; Ranson 1974). In this 50-year-old African American woman with scleral icterus and a 4-cm epigastric mass on examination, the most appropriate initial diagnostic study is a right‐upper‐quadrant (RUQ) abdominal ultrasound to confirm biliary dilation and evaluate for a mass, guiding subsequent imaging and management.

Clinical Presentation and Courvoisier’s Sign
Dyspeptic Symptoms and Jaundice
This patient’s 1-month history of postprandial heartburn, belching, and bloating, refractory to antacids, could reflect functional dyspepsia or peptic ulcer disease, yet the onset of mild scleral icterus indicates hepatobiliary involvement (Talley & Ford 2015). Jaundice results when bilirubin—either unconjugated or conjugated—accumulates in tissues; scleral icterus suggests a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, often from cholestatic or obstructive processes (Pounder 2001).
Courvoisier’s Sign
A palpable, non‐tender gallbladder in the setting of painless jaundice—Courvoisier’s sign—strongly implies obstruction of the distal common bile duct (CBD) by an extrinsic mass, such as a pancreatic head adenocarcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma (Courvoisier 1890; Ranson 1974). Gallstones, by contrast, typically cause a shrunken, fibrotic gallbladder and are less likely to present with a palpable mass (Courvoisier 1890). In one series, Courvoisier’s sign had a positive predictive value of 87% for malignancy in obstructive jaundice (Lo et al. 1996).

Differential Diagnosis of Obstructive Jaundice with Palpable Epigastric Mass
Pancreatic head carcinoma: The most common cause of malignant distal biliary obstruction; risk factors include smoking, chronic pancreatitis, and family history (Ben Q et al. 2011).


Cholangiocarcinoma (distal): May present similarly but less frequently produces a palpable mass (Razumilava & Gores 2014).


Ampullary carcinoma: Can cause obstructive jaundice and weight loss, though less commonly a palpable gallbladder (Chung & Pawlik 2012).


Mirizzi syndrome: Impacted cystic duct stone compressing the common hepatic duct; rarely large enough to be palpable (Beltrán 2008).


Benign biliary stricture: From chronic pancreatitis or iatrogenic injury, but gallbladder usually not palpable (Lillemoe & Cameron 2004).


Given the absence of abdominal pain, weight loss—though unmentioned—and the presence of painless jaundice with a firm epigastric mass, a malignant obstruction is most likely, with pancreatic head adenocarcinoma leading the differential.

Imaging Modalities in Suspected Biliary Obstruction
Right‐Upper‐Quadrant Ultrasound
RUQ ultrasound is the recommended initial imaging study for suspected biliary obstruction (ASGE Standards of Practice Committee 2010). Advantages include:
Noninvasiveness, wide availability, and low cost.


High sensitivity (up to 95%) and specificity (up to 99%) for detecting biliary dilation (Agarwal et al. 2012).


Ability to visualize gallstones, gallbladder wall thickening, and proximal biliary tree dilatation (Lee & Schlachter 2000).


In obstructive jaundice, ultrasound typically demonstrates intrahepatic and extrahepatic ductal enlargement (“double duct sign”), and may visualize a pancreatic head mass if >2 cm (Eisenberg & Goldman 1994). Identification of ductal dilation guides further cross‐sectional imaging.
Contrast‐Enhanced Computed Tomography
Multiphasic contrast‐enhanced CT (CECT) of the abdomen is the gold standard for evaluating pancreatic masses, assessing local invasion, vascular involvement, and detecting distant metastases (Tempero et al. 2017). CT sensitivity for pancreatic adenocarcinoma is approximately 90%, and specificity 89% (Benson et al. 2009). However, CT is resource‐intensive, involves ionizing radiation, and should follow initial ultrasound confirmation of obstruction.
Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography
MRCP provides detailed, noninvasive imaging of the biliary and pancreatic ducts without contrast injection, useful for identifying strictures and small tumors (Schima et al. 2004). MRCP’s sensitivity and specificity mirror those of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for biliary strictures but without therapeutic capability.
Endoscopic Ultrasound
EUS offers high‐resolution visualization of the pancreas and periampullary region, with sensitivity >90% for small tumors (<2 cm) and the ability to perform fine‐needle aspiration (FNA) for tissue diagnosis (Gardner et al. 2005). EUS is indicated when CT is inconclusive or to sample lesions.
ERCP
ERCP allows direct ductal imaging and therapeutic interventions (stenting), but carries risks of pancreatitis (3–10%) and perforation (0.1–0.6%) (Andriulli et al. 2007). ERCP is reserved for cases requiring biliary decompression or tissue sampling when noninvasive imaging is nondiagnostic.

Rationale for Ultrasound as First‐Line Study
Clinical Guidelines: Both the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the American College of Radiology recommend ultrasound as the initial test in suspected biliary obstruction (ASGE 2010; ACR Appropriateness Criteria 2018).


High Detection Rate for Obstruction: Ultrasound reliably demonstrates biliary dilation, which is the key first step in confirming obstruction (Agarwal et al. 2012).


Triage Function: A positive ultrasound (ductal dilation) prompts cross‐sectional imaging (CT or MRCP) to characterize the obstruction’s cause, while a negative ultrasound with high clinical suspicion may still require CT (Blackford et al. 2010).


Safety and Accessibility: Ultrasound avoids radiation and contrast nephropathy—particularly important in patients with comorbidities—and is widely available in outpatient and emergency settings.


In this patient, RUQ ultrasound will quickly confirm extrahepatic obstruction, visualize gallstones versus mass effect, and guide the next diagnostic steps with CT or MRCP.

Subsequent Diagnostic and Therapeutic Pathway
If ultrasound shows biliary dilation without stones: Obtain CECT to localize and stage a pancreatic or periampullary mass (Tempero et al. 2017).


If CT identifies a mass: Employ EUS‐guided FNA for histologic diagnosis prior to surgical planning (Gardner et al. 2005).


Multidisciplinary evaluation: Pancreatic head adenocarcinoma management involves surgical resection (pancreaticoduodenectomy) in resectable cases, often preceded or followed by chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/nab‐paclitaxel) (National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2021).


Palliative options: For unresectable tumors, ERCP with biliary stenting relieves jaundice and pruritus, improving quality of life (Andriulli et al. 2007).



Conclusion
In a 50-year-old woman with new‐onset dyspeptic symptoms, scleral icterus, and a palpable epigastric mass—consistent with Courvoisier’s sign—the most appropriate initial diagnostic study is right‐upper‐quadrant abdominal ultrasound. Ultrasound quickly confirms or excludes biliary obstruction, identifies ductal dilation, and elucidates potential calculi or mass lesions, thereby directing further imaging (CT or MRCP) and invasive diagnostics (EUS, ERCP) as needed. Early, evidence‐based imaging expedites diagnosis, staging, and management of pancreatic head carcinoma or other causes of obstructive jaundice, optimizing outcomes in this high‐risk patient population.

What factors in this patient is most indicative of a poor prognosis?]""","The single factor in this patient’s history that most portends an adverse outcome once thyroid cancer develops is her prior therapeutic irradiation of the neck. Although age, tumor size, and tumor multifocality also influence prognosis, it is well established that childhood exposure to external‐beam radiation—in her case, mantle irradiation for Hodgkin lymphoma at age 12—both increases the risk of thyroid carcinoma and is associated with a more aggressive clinical course, with higher rates of multifocality, nodal involvement, and recurrence (Ringel et al. 2012; Veiga et al. 2011; Rubino et al. 2003).

Epidemiology and Risk Factors for Thyroid Carcinoma
Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common thyroid malignancy and generally carries an excellent prognosis, with 10‐year survival exceeding 90% (Haugen et al. 2016). Established risk factors for PTC include:
Prior radiation exposure, especially during childhood (e.g., therapeutic or environmental)


Family history of thyroid carcinoma (e.g., familial non‐medullary thyroid carcinoma)


Iodine intake extremes, both deficient and excess states


Certain genetic syndromes (e.g., Cowden, familial adenomatous polyposis)


Among these, the radiation‐exposed thyroid is prone not only to an increased incidence of carcinoma but also to more aggressive features—multifocality, lymphovascular invasion, and nodal and distant metastases—that adversely impact long‐term outcomes (Ringel et al. 2012).

Radiation Exposure as a Poor Prognostic Indicator
Mechanistic Insights
DNA Damage and Genomic Instability
 Ionizing radiation induces double‐strand DNA breaks and chromosomal rearrangements (e.g., RET/PTC fusions) that underlie aggressive tumor biology (Nikiforov & Nikiforova 2011).


Latency and Tumor Biology
 Childhood radiation–induced PTC often presents after a latency of 10–20 years, with tumors demonstrating increased genomic complexity, multifocality, and a propensity for nodal involvement (Veiga et al. 2011).


Clinical Evidence
Multifocality and Recurrence
 In a cohort of patients with childhood radiation–associated PTC, >50% had multifocal disease versus ~30% in sporadic cases; recurrence rates were similarly elevated (Sigurdson et al. 2005).


Nodal Metastases
 Radiation‐exposed patients show higher rates of central and lateral neck lymph node metastases at presentation, a known risk factor for locoregional recurrence (Ito et al. 2007).


Survival Impact
 While overall survival remains high, disease‐specific survival is reduced in radiation‐associated PTC compared with sporadic PTC, particularly in those with advanced age at presentation or with extensive nodal disease (Thompson et al. 2008).



Other Prognostic Factors in Thyroid Cancer
Although radiation history is paramount in this patient, other factors known to affect prognosis include:
Age at diagnosis


In PTC, age ≥55 years (AJCC 8th edition) upstages patients and increases mortality risk (Haugen et al. 2016).


This patient is 50, below that threshold.


Tumor Size


Tumors >4 cm are associated with higher recurrence and mortality (Kim et al. 2008).


Her largest nodule measures 2.5 cm, conferring intermediate risk.


Extrathyroidal Extension


Gross extension beyond the thyroid capsule (T3/T4 disease) worsens prognosis (Pacini et al. 2012).


No evidence on exam suggests extrathyroidal invasion.


Multifocality


Presence of multiple tumor foci increases recurrence risk, particularly in the central neck compartment (Ito et al. 2007).


Our patient has bilateral nodules, raising multifocality concerns—but this is often a downstream effect of radiation‐induced genomic instability rather than an independent prognostic factor in the absence of histology.


Lymph Node Metastases


Nodal metastases at presentation increase locoregional recurrence risk but have a limited effect on disease‐specific survival in younger patients (Haugen et al. 2016).


Distant Metastases


The strongest adverse prognostic indicator, but not evident in this clinically well patient (Chow et al. 1999).



Implications for Management and Surveillance
Because of her radiation history, this patient requires:
Thorough diagnostic evaluation
 – Ultrasound‐guided fine‐needle aspiration biopsy of each dominant nodule (American Thyroid Association [ATA] 2015).
 – Preoperative neck ultrasound to assess for nodal involvement.


Aggressive primary therapy
 – Total thyroidectomy rather than lobectomy is often recommended in radiation‐exposed patients to address multifocality and facilitate postoperative radioiodine therapy (Haugen et al. 2016).


Radioiodine Remnant Ablation
 – Considered for patients with radiation‐induced PTC due to higher recurrence risk (Pacini et al. 2012).


Lifelong Surveillance
 – Periodic ultrasound and thyroglobulin measurement for early detection of recurrence, with a lower threshold for imaging in radiation‐exposed survivors (Mazzaferri & Jhiang 1994).



Conclusion
In summary, the feature in this patient most predictive of an adverse thyroid cancer prognosis is her history of childhood mantle irradiation for Hodgkin lymphoma. Childhood therapeutic radiation not only increases the lifetime risk of developing papillary thyroid carcinoma but also confers an aggressive tumor phenotype—multifocality, nodal involvement, and higher recurrence rates—that necessitates a more intensive surgical and postoperative management strategy. While her bilateral nodules, intermediate tumor size, and smoking history contribute to her risk profile, it is her early‐life radiation exposure that most profoundly influences both her risk of thyroid cancer and her likely clinical course.
